<h1>Wolf</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Wolf's attributes and moveset give him a versatile gameplan, somewhere in the middle ground between Fox's focus on pressure and Falco's focus on punishes. This is reflected in his attributes: he has a slow dashing speed (though his initial dash is quite fast), an above-average walking speed, the 11th fastest falling speed, above-average air acceleration, and high gravity, most of which are not uncharacteristic of the Star Fox characters. Unlike the other "space animals", however, Wolf has the 6th fastest air speed in the game. This grants him mobility that is fairly average overall, but relatively balanced compared to Fox and Falco. Additionally, Wolf is also significantly heavier than them, as he is a middleweight (tied with the Ice Climbers, Lucario, Villager, Mythra, and Steve). Although Wolf's special moveset and vertical mobility are derived from his fellow Star Fox fighters, the similarities end there, with Wolf's being the most unique of the trio.

Wolf's Blaster is the centerpiece of his neutral game. With the lasers causing higher knockback (and therefore hitstun) than the average projectile, and having a long duration with transcendent priority, they grant him the ability to disrupt opponents' approaches, even when their grounded mobility is superior to his own, and its unique close-range hitbox on the bayonet give it some utility in close combat, dealing substantial damage if it connects. Lasers can often force opponents to jump over them, leaving them vulnerable to Wolf's fast aerial attacks; these are comprised of a fast neutral aerial that has a lingering hitbox with a powerful clean hit, a disjointed forward aerial that can combo into itself and his other aerials, a back aerial with moderate startup offset by its high power, an up aerial with fast startup and a wide arc well-suited to juggling, and a down aerial that consistently meteor smashes opponents.

Wolf also possesses large hitboxes on several of his attacks with many of them being disjointed, greatly aiding his devastating punish game as he can easily combo and deal massive damage from very few openings. While he can apply pressure from a distance, Wolf's close range options are not lacking either. Forward tilt and down tilt are decent poking tools, the latter which can trip at low percents. Forward smash has slow startup, but is very powerful and has deceptively low ending lag, while up smash deals high damage, covers a wide area around him, and has decent knockback. His neutral and forward aerials are quite fast and difficult to punish even if shielded, while his standing grab is tied for the fastest in the game. Further augmenting his strong neutral game are his dash attack and Reflector, the former which is useful for punishing aerial approaches and KOing at very high percents, and the latter which allows him to deal with opposing camping while also having a close range hit that can be followed up with aerials.

Once Wolf has won the neutral exchange, he has several options to rack up damage. Forward aerial can combo into itself, other aerials and into a grab at very low percents, from which up throw can lead into another forward or up aerial until mid to high percents. Down throw can lead into a dash attack at low percents, while dash attack can extend the combo by chaining into up tilt or up aerial at very low percents. Should an opponent air dodge in an attempt to escape pressure, Wolf's aerial mobility allows him to chase them down and punish them, usually with up tilt or up aerial to continue juggling them, or with a back aerial to send them offstage.

After Wolf has inflicted a sufficient amount of damage, he can then attempt to score a KO via his numerous KO options. The most reliable one is his back aerial: its quick autocancel and decent range allow it to be spaced safely, and it can KO relatively early if sweetspotted (at around 110% from center-stage), while still possessing respectable power with its sourspots. His side special, Wolf Flash, can either meteor smash or semi-spike opponents at the end of the dash depending on which hitbox connects, both of which are noticeably powerful. Wolf's up special, Fire Wolf, consists of looping hits and a deceptively strong last hit.

Other notable finishers are his forward smash and down smash: the former is safe on shield and potentially when whiffed thanks to it possessing deceptively low ending lag in spite of its high startup, whereas the latter posseses a powerful sweetspot that enables it to KO as low as 50% at the edge and makes it an effective 2 frame punish. At higher percents, Wolf has several other moves (forward tilt, sweetspotted up tilt, dash attack, clean neutral aerial, and back throw) that each sport respectable KO potentials in the event he is unable to land his primary KO options.

However, Wolf does possess noticeable weaknesses, the most notable of which is his recovery. Wolf Flash and Fire Wolf are both linear and offer below-average travel distance compared to other recovery options. Unlike Fox and Falco, Wolf's respective side and up specials render him helpless; this essentially restricts him to using only one or the other as a recovery option, which leaves him with a much shorter recovery distance overall. This also leaves Wolf highly vulnerable to gimps and edgeguarding, with meteor smashes in particular being deadly against him even at low percents, to the point exploiting his recovery offsets the increased horizontal endurance his higher weight would otherwise provide.

Though he is not short of finishers, Wolf can frequently have difficulty landing his most powerful ones due to their slow startup (with back aerial and all his smash attacks having more than 12 frames of startup), his below-average dashing speed, and his lack of guaranteed setups into them. Although he possesses true setups into Wolf Flash, such as from his forward aerial or down throw at medium percents, they are very risky to pull off, as he can either end up offstage after its use and thus inadvertently self-destruct (since it renders him helpless) or miss the sweetspots and end up vulnerable due to its high landing lag. Lastly, Wolf is, like Fox and Falco, very susceptible to combos because of his high falling speed and gravity. However, Wolf's heavier weight and lack of sufficiently fast options to escape pressure (his fastest aerial attacks come out on frame 7) make this weakness even more apparent compared to Fox and Falco.

Overall, Wolf is a non-traditional glass cannon. He sacrifices the power of other glass cannons like Mewtwo and Mr. Game & Watch for sheer versatility, due to his combination of an effective projectile for disrupting and forcing approaches, fast approach options of his own, and an abundance of combo and KO options, which allow him to keep up the pressure on his opponent even after winning the neutral game. As such, Wolf is able to adapt to nearly any playstyle. However, due to his vulnerability to combos, poor recovery and trouble securing KOs, Wolf must also be well aware of his opponents, as a single mistake can cause him to sustain heavy damage from combos and end up in a position where he in turn can easily be KO'd.</p>
