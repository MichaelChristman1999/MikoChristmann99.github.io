<h1>Mii Swordighter</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>The Mii Swordfighter has had their physical attributes reworked to all be relatively average. No longer determinant on the weight given to whatever Mii they're based on, the Mii Swordfighter is now an average-height, semi-heavyweight fighter, being heavy as Cloud. Their walk and running speed are fairly average, however they have a relatively high air speed and bear the distinction of being the only Mii Fighter who cannot wall jump. Being a Mii Fighter, the Mii Swordfighter's special moves are determinant on the player's choice, as each special move slot can hold one of three available moves. They possess a total of 12 special moves: Gale Strike, Shuriken of Light, and Blurring Blade (Neutral Special), Airborne Assault, Gale Stab, and Chakram (Side Special), Stone Scabbard, Skyward Slash Dash, and Hero's Spin (Up Special), and Blade Counter, Reversal Slash, and Power Thrust (Down Special).

One of the greatest strengths of the Mii Swordfighter is their extremely versatile and flexible set of specials, some of which are among the strongest moves in the game. Gale Strike and Chakram are fantastic projectiles which excel at distancing opponents, racking up damage, and edgeguarding. Gale Strike is among the Mii Swordfighter's best moves; while slow for a projectile, it does good damage, is an excellent tool to setup kill confirms due to its large hitbox and fixed knockback, and is very potent at ledgetrapping. Landing a Gale Strike allows the Mii Swordfighter to confirm into a multitude of moves such as back aerial, forward aerial, up aerial, Hero's Spin, and Chakram. Hero's Spin in particular is an extremely potent kill option, being able to take stocks as low as around 40% when confirming out of a Gale Strike at the ledge. Chakram is another potent projectile that is good for both initiating and deterring approaches. The smash input version is good for edgeguarding opponents with especially poor recoveries (i.e. Belmonts and Cloud) and the tilt input version allows the Mii Swordfighter to pressure the ledge and confirm into many different moves, providing them with two tools that establish a good defense-oriented playstyle. Along with being one of the few swordfighters that have access to projectiles, the Mii Swordfighter is also the only one that possesses a reflector in the form of Reversal Slash, which allows them to counter campy, projectile-heavy opponents as well. Additionally, Blade Counter, like other counters, can effectively edgeguard those who possess poor recoveries, though it isn't as effective for KO'ing near the side blast lines due to its' extensive vertical knockback. However, this does provide it with consistent KO potential.

Outside of their strong projectiles, the Mii Swordfighter possesses a few of fast and powerful normals. Back and up aerial are both very fast and powerful, the former of which is a strong tool to use for spacing and the latter for anti-airs and racking damage. Forward and neutral aerial both serve as average spacing tools, with forward air's multihits giving Mii Swordfighter several confirms on grounded opponents. Additionally, almost all of the Swordfighter's aerials can easily be comboed into from their down throw, giving the character extremely reliable damage from grabs. This, along with low aerial landing lag (with the exception of down aerial at 18 frames) results in the Mii Swordfighter having an above average aerial game due to most of their aerials being potential combo starters, while their down aerial, despite having weak set knockback, is great for gimping opponents with subpar recoveries alongside neutral and back aerial. The Mii Swordfighter's tilts, with the exception of forward tilt, are quite fast and are pretty reliable sources of damage and combo potential. Swordfighter's jab combo is relatively strong and launches at a very low angle, making it an option at setting up edgeguards and gimps. Their up tilt is generally used for juggling and starting combos at medium percentages, while their forward tilt and down tilt are more geared towards spacing and poking. The former is able to KO at mid-to-high percents near the ledge, making it a decent KO move, while the latter is safe on shield if spaced, can be used repeatedly without much risk, and reliably leads into combos at lower percents, making it another dependable combo starter the Swordfighter has.

Alongside their potent aerials and tilts are a set of powerful smash attacks and specials. While forward and up smash are both relatively laggy, they both boast a considerable amount of KO power and the same can be said for Blurring Blade and Power Thrust, the former which can KO at extremely low percents when fully charged at the edge of Final Destination.

Additionally, the Mii Swordfighter arguably has the best recovery options out of the three Mii Fighters. As in SSB4, Airborne Assault and Gale Stab both boast an incredible amount of horizontal distance while Stone Scabbard provides a high vertical distance. Skyward Slash Dash is a move similar to that of Fire Fox (with a difference being that it is disjointed), allowing the Mii Swordfighter to have both increased distance and a trajectory that can mix up edgeguarding opponents.

However, in spite of the variety of strengths that the Mii Swordfighter has, they are not without their weaknesses. For a swordfighter, they have one of (if not the worst) disjoints in the game. Many of their swift normals simply have a lack of range in comparison to other swordfighters such as Lucina and Ike. Additionally, as mentioned before, their mobility is also very lackluster compared to other disjoint users given their average dashing/walking and air acceleration speeds, which makes it difficult for them to keep up with faster, rushdown-based characters (i.e. Sonic). While many of their specials have some form of use, there are a few that provide utility that's considered to be overshadowed compared to other specials, such as Gale Stab, which has trouble snapping to the ledge and has limited KO power and damage unless charged; and Blurring Blade, which suffers from being completely unsafe on shield, having to be charged to gain its high power, and not only sacrificing the use of two great projectiles to be used, but also having limited range itself. While Airborne Assault provides great recovery and sports surprising KO power, its "detection hitbox" mechanic means it will always lose hitbox trades and sometimes even miss opponents it should have hit, as well as being unsafe on shield, limiting its use to reading defensive options or poor aerial approaches, as well as situationally hitting ledge-hanging characters.

Furthermore, while many of the Mii Swordfighter's normals are good, their smash attacks are all very laggy and have generally poor reach, especially their up smash, which does not have a vacuum effect like that of Link, Samus, or the Mii Gunner while their good normals begin to lose their utility at higher percentages. Down tilt loses its' combo ability at mid percentages and up tilt is a fairly sluggish move against faster opponents. Additionally, their grab game is subpar, though not to the same extent as Cloud. Aside from down throw, the Mii Swordfighter's throws offer mediocre utility, especially their up throw, which deals extremely low knockback and damage and has no true follow ups. Their throws also have mediocre KO power, with their strongest throw being back throw (which doesn't KO at around 180% at the edge of Final Destination). While Gale Strike and Chakram are still very good projectiles, their start and end lag are both substantial in comparison to other projectiles, making them unsafe to use up close, further exacerbating their struggle against faster characters and giving them a rather poor neutral. Lastly, while their recovery can be very flexible, some of them either offer poor distance or are quite linear, such as Stone Scabbard which provides no horizontal distance and poses a great risk of self destructing, and Hero's Spin, which while is a good out of shield option and has a very powerful final hit, exchanges said strengths for very poor distance.

Overall, the Mii Swordfighter is a jack of all trades amalgamation of all weapon based fighters. The ability to mix and match several different special moves adds a unique layer of versatility by allowing several different playstyles for the same basic fighter, making Mii Swordfighter among the most unpredictable to fight against. However, all of the customizable special moves have a fatal flaw to prevent them from being overpowered and/or are an inferior version of a similar move other fighters possess. Mii Swordfighter is capable of walling out opponents, racking up damage, and securing a plethora of different kill confirms. They excel in mid-close range combat and ledgetrapping with the usage of Chakram and Gale Strike and can restrict projectile usage with Reversal Slash. However, they exchange these strengths for a variety of laggy finishers, a subpar grab game and average movement speed. Despite this, their strengths do outweigh their weaknesses and they have a good number of favorable or even matchups. As a result, the Mii Swordfighter has seen a surprisingly high amount of representation and results in tournaments.</p>
