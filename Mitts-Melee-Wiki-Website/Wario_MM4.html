<h1>Wario</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Wario is a short heavyweight character with a great air game and surprisingly fantastic movement in the air. He boasts the 8th fastest air speed in the game, in addition to being tied for the 2nd best air acceleration. Wario also sports an above average falling speed and the 26th highest gravity, which alongside the previous attributes gives him an amazing aerial prowess despite having low jumps. However, his grounded mobility pales in comparison, as his dashing speed and traction are average at best, and his walking speed is the 12th slowest in the game. Using his high mobility and versatile aerial attacks, Wario is able to dip in and out of the fray to bait attacks and punish. Wario's attacks in general also tend to be disjointed, as his hands don't have a hurtbox. He's also fairly hard to hit since he's relatively nimble and short for a heavy character, though fairly wide, meaning he can still be vulnerable to combos and juggles.

Furthermore, Wario boasts strong aerials, with his down, and back aerials being potent kill moves, while the up aerial is a highly damaging juggling and combo extension tool, with limited killing ability as well. Thanks to Ultimate's universal 3-frame jumpsquat, he can finally utilize his forward and neutral aerials as fast moves that can combo and pressure his opponents. Wario's air control and quick aerials also make him very effective at edgeguarding.

Wario's ground game contrasts with his air game in that it focuses more on power than speed. His forward tilt and forward smash are among the strongest in the cast, although both are rather slow, and the latter is best suited for hard reads. His up and down tilts are great combo tools that could potentially lead into kill moves, and his new shoulder tackle dash attack is both extremely fast in terms of startup and one of the strongest dash attacks in the game.

Wario's grabs are not particularly fast but have above average range. His throws have their fair share utility, with his up throw being able to combo into his up aerial and his down throw being both quite damaging and great for keeping opponents close to pressure them further. Forward throw deals decent damage, and back throw having a strong collateral hitbox that is good at knocking away other combatants.

Wario's special moves are also very unorthodox, and they demand practice to be usable at their highest potentials. Chomp is one of the best command grabs in the game, having deceptively long range and decent startup. It heals Wario if it connects, can effectively cover certain edge recoveries and even kill at high percents, negate certain attacks such as Wonderwing, and absorb many projectiles, often with the benefit of further healing him and slightly increasing the charge of his Wario Waft. His Waft is his most significant move because, with time, it is a highly damaging kill move with an extremely fast startup. With Waft in his arsenal, any match can be turned around with the right read. Wario Bike gives Wario an unorthodox approach option that covers for his fairly slow ground movement, and the bike itself continues to move forward and hit opposing fighters even after Wario dismounts it. This gives him a large pseudo-projectile which can apply pressure when used effectively, but the bike has a respawn time which prevents this from being used as a normal projectile. It can be used to surprise unsuspecting players as an approach tool that can blow past some projectiles, dismounted and thrown like an item with kill power, a very effective recovery tool, and a way for Wario to heal and charge his Waft when he eats it. On the flip side, Wario cannot shield or dodge while on the bike and is vulnerable, opponents can throw it right back at him, and if it's destroyed, he has to wait six seconds before using it again, which can leave him helpless while recovering as his up special, the Corkscrew is rather lackluster as a recovery on its own (although it is a decent out-of-shield option as it is his fastest recovery move).

For all of his strengths, Wario does have several weaknesses to counterbalance them. His range is rather mediocre, especially in moves such as neutral aerial and forward aerial, and he lacks projectile attacks outside of a dismounted Wario Bike and thus must take a risk to deal damage. While his bike recovery can go a far distance, it is fairly easy to gimp him when he uses it, so Wario players have to be careful with when and how it is used. While Wario does have some fast moves, he is certainly slower and heavier on average than most characters that share his weaknesses, so he can sometimes be overwhelmed in the neutral against small characters with better range than him. Wario will have to use his overall high mobility to bait his opponents into making mistakes and capitalize on them with his highly damaging combos and powerful kill moves.

Despite having a variety of KO moves, Wario can have a difficult time landing them. Firstly, he is burdened with a rather poor set of smash attacks. All three have extremely high ending lag and are very unsafe on shield making them easily punishable while only having average or slightly above average power. Forward smash is very strong but suffers from slow startup and very high ending lag with deceptively short range, up smash has decent startup and grants Wario head intangibility, but has massive ending lag to the point where Wario will be standing at the end of the animation of the move and still be in lag. Finally, down smash has fast startup coming out on frame 8, but has extreme ending lag and very mediocre power which makes it one of Wario's least useful moves. His other KO moves such as his Back aerial, forward tilt and Dash attack also suffer from being sluggish or predictable on top of lacking legitimate kill throws as his forward throw has had its knockback reduced from its previous iteration. This means Wario can often be reliant on Wario Waft for an easier, early KO and is left with a more difficult process of finishing off opponents should it miss.

All in all, Wario is a quite mobile and versatile heavyweight brawler that rewards patient players who know how to use his movement and signature Waft to their fullest potentials. His damage-racking ability and kill power also rewards players heavily for finding creative ways to get around his rather poor range and lack of a proper projectile, and his versatile options and movement give players just the tools to do it.</p>
