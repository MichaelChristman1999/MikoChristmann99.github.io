<h1>Incineroar</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Incineroar draws many comparisons to some of the slowest, hardest-hitting fighters in Super Smash Bros. history: it is a tall super heavyweight (being tied with Charizard as the 6th heaviest character) who has the 19th fastest falling speed, the 11th highest gravity, and average air acceleration. However, Incineroar is the overall slowest character in the game, with the slowest walking and dashing speeds in the game, and the 8th slowest initial dash and air speed.

As a character that pays homage to professional wrestling, Incineroar's moveset boasts an abundance of single-hit attacks and throws, and its attacks have respectably large hitboxes for a close-range fighter of its mobility. Contrary to its sluggish movement and high weight, Incineroar's frame data is surprisingly above average, with fast to decent startup and respectable ending lag in spite of their damage. Unlike most other hard hitters, Incineroar's weaker attacks are fairly reliable combo starters that work at a wide percent range, giving its moveset an excellent amount of utility. Meanwhile, most of its stronger moves are greatly damaging and, in many cases, capable of KOing early. As expected of a super heavyweight, rage helps Incineroar KO easier, and it is able to take advantage of it easily thanks to its weight.

Unsurprisingly for a professional wrestling-inspired fighter, Incineroar's greatest asset is its excellent grab game. While Incineroar's grab range is average, its grabs are decently quick, last longer than average (though its dash grab and pivot grab are slow), and it has one of the best sets of throws among the entire cast, all of which deal respectable damage. Its forward, back and up throws are all strong (with forward throw being the strongest of its kind in the game), whereas down throw is the core of its combo game. The latter can lead into various aerials (including down aerial, though due to its slow speed, this makes it a mix-up), forward and dashing up smash at very low percentages, and Darkest Lariat. It can also potentially lead to a risky sacrificial KO with Cross Chop, which will always result in the opponent being KO'd first.

Forward throw has high knockback even at low percentages, making it an acceptable throw to set up an edgeguard at percentages where down throw won't combo anymore, and to KO at high percentages near the edge. Back throw, when performed at the edge, can potentially rival Ness' own back throw as the strongest throw in the game, and can KO light characters exceptionally early; however, due to its launch angle, lack of damage during the actual throw (as it consists of a hit before the opponent is thrown), and lackluster resistance to DI, it can be survived if done mid-stage and technically can be considered inferior to Ness'. Finally, up throw is Incineroar's most reliable KO throw due to being one the strongest of its kind (only surpassed by Olimar's up throw), and easily KOs earlier with the assistance of platforms and/or a low-hanging upper blast line. Overall, Incineroar has KO throws for any given situation, while also having a reliable combo starter.

Similarly to some of its fellow super heavyweights, Incineroar also possesses a unique grab; in this case, a command grab that functions as its side special, Alolan Whip. Upon execution, the player must press the attack or special button again after the throw initiates, and depending on timing, it has three outcomes: performing it early will result in a back body drop that has high vertical knockback that scales slowly, performing it too late will result in the opponent harmlessly bouncing back while damaging Incineroar, and performing it cleanly (as the opponent is about to collide with Incineroar) results in a lariat that is one of Incineroar's strongest moves, thanks to its very high horizontal knockback and low launching angle. Even the early and failure versions of the move have their uses, with the back body drop KOing earlier while near the upper blast line, and the collision being usable to set up a reversal.

Incineroar's grounded moveset is a good example of its fast frame data for its high damage and power. Neutral attack is tied for the second fastest attack in Incineroar's moveset, and it is tied with King K. Rool, Ike and Wario's neutral attacks for the third most damaging non-infinite neutral attack in the entire game, being surpassed only by Kazuya and Terry's. Forward tilt is the strongest of its kind in the game when sweetspotted, and is Incineroar's quickest KO option on the ground due to its high knockback and semi-spike angle. Up tilt and down tilt serve similar purposes, being combo starters that can set up into Incineroar's other moves. Up tilt can link into itself at low percentages and into aerials at low to middle ones, and serves as an anti-air due to invincibility on Incineroar's head. Conversely, down tilt has longer range, lowers Incineroar's hurtbox, and has excellent combo potential throughout all percentages, allowing combos into up tilt or up smash at low percentages or aerials at high percentages, including KO confirms into back aerial, up aerial or Darkest Lariat.

Dash attack's clean hitbox makes it is one of the strongest attacks of its kind in the game, but is mainly useful as a burst KO option when fresh, as Incineroar's slow speed can make it quite predictable. Finally, Incineroar's smash attacks have their own unique perks. Forward smash comes out surprisingly quickly, KOs extremely early when sweetspotted at the foot (being the 4th strongest when sweetspotted), and deals good shield damage. Up smash has a wide, consistently strong hitbox and grants intangibility, which make it useful for both anti-air tactics and KOing outright. Finally, down smash momentarily shifts Incineroar's hurtbox upwards, allowing it to dodge grabs, attacks, and even projectiles to act as a hard punish.

A few of Incineroar's aerial moves are also useful. Neutral aerial is also tied for its second fastest attack and has a large hitbox all-around. When sweetspotted, it can be used to KO offstage; if not, it can still function as a powerful combo starter, especially for an out of shield option. Up aerial is Incineroar's go-to aerial juggle option due to its wide hitbox and its capability of comboing from up and down tilts. Down aerial is a powerful meteor smash that can still KO even if the sourspot hits, and at lower percentages, sets the opponent up for a combo. Forward and back aerials are Incineroar's main way to KO opponents in the air, aside from Alolan Whip, thanks to their faster startup. Due to its aerials' power and decent enough recovery, Incineroar's edgeguarding game is respectable.

Incineroar's other special moves complete its moveset with a few versatile tools. Darkest Lariat is Incineroar's get-off-me option, possessing fast startup (being tied for neutral attack and neutral aerial as its second fastest attack), a long duration, transcendent priority throughout its hitboxes, invincibility on its arms, and a very strong early hit. Though its power gradually weakens over time, its perks allow it to outprioritize many moves (even weak projectiles) while hitting hard. Cross Chop is Incineroar's main recovery move; it can contest against other attacks due to its super armor during the start, and the descending hit deals high knockback. It is also a powerful combo finisher or sacrificial KO, as the initial descent's high base knockback allows it to gimp any character at 0% should the descending hit connect.

Finally, Revenge is a unique counterattack that retaliates with a weak hit, but stores a stackable power increase that affects Incineroar's next move; with a sufficiently strong buff, it grants exorbitantly powerful punishes, with moves such as forward smash, Darkest Lariat, Alolan Whip, and most infamously back throw turning into some of the strongest attacks in the game. While the buff lasts for one landed move, it is not lost should the attack hit an opponent's shield, making Incineroar's moves generally safe on block and can even result in the opponent's shield being broken if they keep shielding, leading to their doom.

However, Incineroar's powerful abilities come at a severe cost. Its biggest issue comes from its poor neutral game. As mentioned before, Incineroar possesses abysmal mobility; when combined with a lack of a projectile, this makes it very easy to zone out and gives it a terrible approach. While the hitboxes on its moves are large, Incineroar's overall range remains somewhat short, so any sufficiently long-ranged projectile or disjointed range can be enough to keep Incineroar at bay. This is especially troublesome considering the cast is also full of characters with either greater mobility (like Sonic or Zero Suit Samus), superior melee range (like Marth or Donkey Kong), good zoning games (like Villager or Min Min), or in some cases, all three points (like Wolf or Palutena).

Further adding to this is Incineroar's poor air game: although moves like neutral aerial offer good utility, and forward and back aerials have the range to outspace opponents, none of Incineroar's aerials can autocancel from a short hop aside from up aerial (with forward aerial not autocanceling even from a full hop). This significantly limits their use in the neutral game, as their poor autocancel windows make them unable for approaching reliably. In bulk, this gives Incineroar one of the most lackluster neutral games of any character, being one of the characters with the most trouble at getting close to opponents to begin with, and forces it to heavily rely on bait-and-punish tactics in order to get in.

Another prominent issue is Incineroar's recovery. Cross Chop turns into an inevitable self-destruct if Incineroar is not directly below the edge or above stage level, while Alolan Whip grants mediocre distance and has somewhat high ending lag. Incineroar's slow air speed and quick falling speed and high gravity further compound its recovery issues. That said, Alolan Whip can intercept edgeguard attempts thanks to its non-inputted collision, allowing Incineroar to reverse the situation. Furthermore, neither Cross Chop's descent nor Alolan Whip render Incineroar helpless, so Incineroar does have the ability to mix its recovery up when used in tandem with a directional air dodge and its midair jump, especially if it recovers from a high altitude, which adds to its impressive endurance. However, in a similar manner to Marth, if it doesn't have its double jump, Incineroar is very vulnerable to being edgeguarded. Any semi-spike or meteor smash of sufficient strength will almost certainly result in Incineroar being KO'd, and any combo that drags it offstage is usually fatal if it is not at a high enough altitude to recover.

Although its frame data gives it less of an issue breaking out of combos and rushdown tactics, its only reliable options to break through such tactics are neutral aerial, Darkest Lariat and Revenge; the lattermost can also be easily predicted. If it is unable to break through combos, its slow mobility can leave it very vulnerable to consistent rushdowns, in addition to being vulnerable to zoning and spacing. Its poor neutral game further contributes to this, as it can make it very difficult for Incineroar to even get back to a position where it can try to exploit the opponent's offense or defense. Despite its fast falling speed, Incineroar's slow air speed also leaves it vulnerable to juggling. Altogether, all these flaws collectively result in Incineroar having a poor disadvantage state.

Finally, although its moveset has greatly damaging options, Incineroar has surprisingly inconsistent KO potential compared to many of its fellow super heavyweights. While its throws are all strong and some of its other moves possess high knockback at low percentages as a result of their high base knockback, their knockback doesn't grow quickly due to their low knockback scaling. Notable examples of this are neutral and back aerials, back throw, Darkest Lariat and Alolan Whip's back body drop. Notably, some of Incineroar's moves require landing a sweetspot in order to attain their maximum knockback; notable cases include forward tilt (despite the sweetspot being the strongest in the game), forward smash, and both forward and back aerials.

Finally, disregarding its up throw, Incineroar has the worst vertical KO potential of the super heavyweights. Up tilt, up aerial and Alolan Whip's back body drop all have lackluster power, while its up smash, despite being decently strong, is relatively slow for an out of shield option. Revenge can alleviate this issue to a degree, but this requires Incineroar to read the opponent's attack in the first place. In addition, the buff is lost once it has successfully landed an attack, meaning that if Incineroar is forced to attack with one of its weaker moves, it is possible to waste the buff entirely. The buff can also be gradually lost by attacking Incineroar, by waiting after approximately 60 seconds (which is possible due to Incineroar's susceptibility to being outranged or camped), or outright wasted by throwing Incineroar via a regular grab or a command grab, further adding to its inconsistency.

In the end, Incineroar falls within the "grappler" playstyle archetype, which notoriously requires a very specific playstyle to be effective. Incineroar excels at taking advantage of close-range openings, where it can land powerful blows or start consistent combos that rack up damage quickly in only a few hits, all while being difficult for an opponent to punish due to its staying power, relative safety on shield and heavy punish abilities, making Incineroar very formidable once it wins the neutral game and gets in close. However, while it has an incredible overall damage output, it suffers inconsistent KO potential that is mostly reliant on its throws and side special, making it predictable when it comes to scoring a KO.

Additionally, Incineroar suffers from issues similar to Ganondorf, where its poor mobility, middling range, and lack of both a projectile and reliable approach options collectively make it very susceptible to being kept in check and paying a costly price for any wide openings on its end despite having better options to break pressure at close quarters. Because of this, Incineroar is a "high risk, high reward" type of character, and benefits from a patient, largely bait-and-punish oriented playstyle in order to achieve the same momentum its fellow super heavyweights can.

Like Ganondorf, Incineroar is widely considered a low tier character, yet is nevertheless a popular choice at the low- and mid-levels of play because of its attributes and moveset resulting in ludicrous and extravagant punishes that can easily KO an unaware player. By extension, Incineroar usually performs poorly at the highest levels of play, though it has a few notable tournament results thanks to a few notable smashers like brandon, Kusari Katabira, Magister, Sharpy and Skyjay. Skyjay, in particular, has made significant contributions to Incineroar's metagame, although it is uncertain how Incineroar will fare in the long run.</p>
