<h1>Luigi</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Luigi is a middleweight who is quite floaty and has attributes that deviate from most other characters in his weight class. Luigi sports fairly average walking speed, dashing speed, and air acceleration, a decent initial dash, below-average gravity, slow falling speed, low traction, the 2nd slowest air speed, and the 4th highest jumps in the game. As such, Luigi's mobility is fairly sluggish overall, especially in the air.

Luigi's greatest asset is his outstanding frame data, which is easily among the best of the cast. Because of this, similarly to his older brother, Luigi can be very difficult to punish, as only two of his standard moves and five of his attacks overall have more than 9 frames of startup lag (forward smash, down aerial, Fireball, Green Missile, and Luigi Cyclone) and a multitude of moves that hit at or before frame 5, such as neutral attack, dash attack, neutral aerial, up aerial and all of his tilts while the vast majority of his moveset also has low ending lag, giving him among the fastest attack speed of the entire cast and an excellent punish game, which is complemented by the impressive utility of his overall moveset. Neutral attack's damage output and range are decent, and the first two hits can lock. Luigi's tilt attacks also have their own perks: forward tilt can be angled and is useful for spacing, up tilt has excellent combo and juggling potential, and down tilt is an incredibly quick and highly spammable move that can combo into itself and many other moves while also being able to consistently perform 2 frame punishes at the edge. Finally, Luigi's dash attack has quick startup, and with its reduced ending lag as well as its increased damage output and knockback, it is a much better move for approaching and attacking than in previous titles.

Luigi's smash attacks are among the fastest of their kind, have below-average ending lag, and are strong enough to be reliable finishers. As a result of these traits, they allow Luigi to quickly and effectively punish opponents close to him while also rendering him being difficult to punish on shield. Forward smash deals extra shield damage, up smash is an effective anti-air attack due to rendering Luigi's head intangible while its hitboxes are active, and down smash is very useful for punishing rolls thanks to its minimal lag, respectable damage output, and long range. Both up smash and down smash also have set-up potential at low percentages if Luigi successfully covers the opponent's options afterward.

Luigi's aerial attacks are also very useful, having fast startup, lenient auto-cancel windows, quick interruptibility (except for neutral and back aerials) and low ending lag in general. In terms of autocanceling, he can auto-cancel all his aerials with a short hop, can auto-cancel all of them except for neutral aerial with a short hop fast fall and can use forward, up and down aerials twice in a single short hop. Lastly, he can use his forward and up aerials twice with a single short hop without suffering from landing lag. Neutral aerial is a sex kick and, like in previous installments, the only one that launches opponents vertically, which benefits its clean and late hitboxes: the former is a great combo breaker and deals high damage and good knockback, making it a reliable KO option at high percentages, and both are very useful combo starters when SHFF'd, with the latter working even up to high percentages. Forward aerial has the fastest duration of its kind and launches at the Sakurai angle; at low to medium percentages, these traits make it very reliable for approaching or down throw-initiated combos into itself, neutral aerial and up aerial, as well as a reliable edge-guarding option at high percentages. Back aerial has the highest ending lag of Luigi's aerials by a noticeable margin, but other than fast startup, it has a powerful clean hitbox on Luigi's feet and decent range, which enable it to function as a safe and reliable KOing and edge-guarding option, or as an approach option via reverse aerial rush. Up aerial is useful for combos: it can either extend them or, thanks to having the lowest amount of landing lag out his aerials, use its clean hitbox to start them at low percentages when SHFF'd due to its clean hit dealing above-average damage for a combo move. Its generous auto-cancel window and very low ending lag also allow Luigi to use it twice in a single short hop and still auto-cancel it successfully, a trait it shares with his forward aerial and Little Mac's neutral aerial. Lastly, down aerial is safe to use and has a clean hitbox which is a fast meteor smash, coming out on frame 10 and with only 14 frames of ending lag, the lowest of any meteor smash. Due to his powerful aerials with generally low lag all around, Luigi has an outstanding air game.

Luigi has an excellent grab game, but unlike in past installments, he has a tether grab due to using the Poltergust G-00's Suction Shot to grab an opponent. As a result, Luigi can grab opponents from a decent distance, preventing the necessity for him to get up close to do so. It also provides Luigi with a grab aerial, in which the Suction Shot's plunger functions as a projectile that deals minor damage and knockback. This grants Luigi an additional edge-guarding option and situational combo move that, unlike most projectiles, cannot be absorbed or reflected. Like Mario, Luigi has an average pummel, which can deal multiple hits before being followed up with any of his useful throws. Forward throw deals respectable damage and is useful for repositioning opponents or setting up edge-guards against them at higher percentages. Back throw also deals respectable damage and great knockback, allowing it to KO at a mere 120%, or even earlier with rage. Unlike Mario's back throw, it also lacks a noticeably long animation, which makes it harder for the opponent to survive with DI. Up throw deals average damage and knockback, and possesses follow-up potential into forward or up aerials at mid percentages. It also possesses a collateral hitbox to harm bystanders. Lastly, down throw is Luigi's primary combo starter and is one of his most useful attacks: it deals average knockback, has low ending lag, and launches at a vertical angle, which collectively enable it to lead into potent and highly damaging combos, even being able to lead into potential zero-to-deaths. Down throw can combo into moves such as up tilt, up smash, all of Luigi's aerials, Super Jump Punch and Luigi Cyclone, due to its aforementioned traits, and functions as an excellent KO setup tool, being able to lead into Super Jump Punch, back aerial, or Luigi Cyclone at high percents. Although situational, down throw also has a collateral hitbox before the throw that can hit bystanders, similarly to up throw.

As a pseudo-clone of Mario, Luigi has two special moves that are derived from his older brother, yet his versions deviate in noticeable ways. Fireball is a projectile that is useful for pressuring, hindering an opponent's approach, or setting up an attack. Unlike Mario's Fireball, Luigi's is unaffected by gravity and moves up and down, which makes it somewhat less effective at hindering an opponent's recovery attempt, but allows it to cover a consistent area horizontally and vertically. Compared to Mario's version, Luigi's Fireballs also have a clean hit that deals more damage and they have less ending lag, allowing him to throw another one just one frame before the clean hit ceases. Super Jump Punch has fast startup like Mario's, but propels him vertically instead of diagonally. By extension, it consists of a sweetspot and sourspot, instead of multiple hitboxes like Mario's. Its sweetspot boasts devastating power, which makes it a very potent punishment option, yet it is very risky because of its high ending lag and sourspot that is mostly useless outside of being a niche gimping tool.

Aside from these, Luigi's other special moves are completely distinct from Mario's. Green Missile deals damage and covers horizontal distance, both of which can be increased thanks to its ability to be charged, giving KO potential to the fully charged version. However, it also has a one-in-ten random chance of misfiring; in this case, it becomes even stronger than the fully charged version, and travels much further. Lastly, Luigi Cyclone grants Luigi some invincibility frames on startup, enabling him to break out of combos or contest opposing attacks effectively. It also functions as a KOing option near the upper blast line, and is a guaranteed follow-up out of down throw even at high percentages, which can function as a reliable KO combo on platforms.

However, Luigi has some notable disadvantages. He has fairly sluggish mobility, with his extremely slow air speed and floaty physics making it difficult for him to land onstage, especially against faster characters, thus possessing a subpar approach and a weakness to juggling. His range, while better than Mario's, is still below-average and thus leaves him fairly susceptible to getting outspaced by characters with long range, such as Lucina and Shulk. Compared to Mario, Luigi's lack of a reflector also makes it more difficult for him to deal with projectile camping (especially against characters such as Link, Samus, and Simon) when combined with his awkward mobility.

Additionally, Luigi's poor aerial mobility hinders his ability to approach with his aerial attacks, as well as his recovery. On top of this, his recovery, although long-distanced, is linear, slow, predictable and fairly susceptible to gimping. Luigi Cyclone barely grants any additional height compared to previous games, which leaves him reliant on Super Jump Punch and Green Missile for recovering; the former travels directly upward only, and the latter has noticeable lag, cannot sweetspot edges, and relies on either charging or its random misfire chance to cover a serviceable horizontal distance.

Overall, Luigi is a very solid character, though he often tends to run hot-and-cold, unlike his brother. His extremely fast frame data, strong air game, and devastating combos make him a force to be reckoned with, provided his opponents make careless mistakes. Luigi's overall combo game, KO potential, and advantage state are easily superior to his brother's, having many different set-ups that can deal absurdly high damage within seconds, and then score KOs immediately thereafter. However, Luigi's short range - along with his mediocre grounded mobility, abysmal aerial mobility, and predictable side and up specials - force him to fight at close-quarters all the time, hindering both his approach and recovery. Because of this, a mastery of Luigi's recovery mixups and powerful combo game is crucial to achieving success with him.</p>
