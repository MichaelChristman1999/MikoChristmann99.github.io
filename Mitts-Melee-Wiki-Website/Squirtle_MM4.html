<h1>Squirtle</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Squirtle is the smallest and lightest out of the Pokémon Trainer's Pokémon, with it being tied with Mr. Game & Watch for the 3rd-lightest character in the game. Squirtle will automatically be the first Pokémon on-screen if Pokémon Trainer is selected, though this can be manually changed by pressing the Y button on the character select screen. In relation to Pokémon change, the order is Squirtle-Squirtle-Charizard. If Charizard is KOd, Squirtle will always appear on the next revival platform.

Squirtle's small size makes it a hard target to hit, but also gives its attacks (with the exception of its smash attacks) poor range. Squirtle has decent mobility overall, with average dashing and air speeds, a fast walking speed, very high air acceleration (the eighth highest), high gravity and high jump height, but a below-average falling speed and low traction. Squirtle also has the ability to crawl and wall cling.

One of Squirtle's strengths is its excellent frame data, as all of its attacks outside of its smash attacks come out before frame 10 and generally have low ending lag, also giving it a very strong combo game when combined with the low knockback on some of its moves. Starting with its normal ground moves, the first hit of its neutral attack comes out on frame 2; making it useful as a "get off me" option. Forward tilt is one of its most useful tools; the move's low end lag makes it safe on shields, can lead into grabs at lower percentages, and can set up jab locks or tech chases at higher percentages. Up tilt can combo into itself and set up aerial combos. Down tilt, while slower compared to its other moves (coming out at frame 8), has a bit more range and can be useful in 2-framing opponents. Finally, its dash attack can be used to set up some combos at low to mid percentages due to its low lag and Squirtle's aforementioned frame data.

Squirtle's smash attacks are generally much slower compared to its other moves, but compensate with range and power. The start-up for forward smash is high but the end lag is low, has high knockback (being the strongest of its three smash attacks), and can be used to finish off a jab lock combo. Its up smash comes out slightly faster than forward smash, hits on both sides simultaneously, and covers a decent area above it. Finally, its down smash is its fastest smash attack and has good range overall, making it effective as an out of shield option.

Squirtle possesses a strong aerial game. As one of the only few characters in Ultimate whose all five aerials can be auto-canceled in a short hop, Squirtle has multiple options while in the air. Neutral aerial has very fast startup for a neutral aerial at 4 frames while it can also KO at very high percentages near edges, making it an effective for disrupting combos. Forward and back aerials are good for combos, with the former being good for wall of pain combos, while the latter can set up dragdown combos. Due to Squirtle's above average jump height, up aerial is a very effective juggling tool, while the move has among the lowest landing lag of any aerial attack, at 6 frames, furthering its juggling abilities. Its down aerial is a good landing option that can set up combos at low percentages. To cap, all of its aerial attacks have at most 18 frames of landing lag, making them solid air-to-ground options.

Squirtle also has a very effective grab game. Despite its below average grab length and unimpressive damage outputs on its throws, they all have utility. Its forward throw is very effective for edgeguarding and is strong enough to KO at around 160% with no rage. Back throw is a strong KO throw, being one of the strongest in Ultimate, while its up and down throws are potent combo starters. Its pummel, while relatively weak, is decently fast and easily builds up damage.

Finally, when it comes to Squirtle's special moves, its neutral special, Water Gun functions similarly to Mario's down special, being a move that pushes away opponents without making them flinch. The longer the move is charged, the higher the push back, making it a useful tool for edge guarding. Its side special, Withdraw, has Squirtle retreat in its shell and move across the stage at high speeds. It is immune to damage while using this move, which can be used as an approaching tool. Finally, its up special, Waterfall, is a multi-hitting move that covers a decent distance, and is useful for ending combos.

However, Squirtle does have some weaknesses. Squirtle's overall damage output is poor, and outside of its smash attacks (which are slow) and its back throw (which can have trouble killing away from the ledge), Squirtle lacks any fast KO options, especially since some of its previous KO options (such as forward aerial and down throw) were weakened, while neutral, forward and back aerials need edgeguarding to KO, up aerial can only do so near the upper blast line and along with forward throw, they require rage to KO on their own, so Squirtle can sometimes depend on edgeguarding to score KOs. Squirtle also lacks reliable KO combos as well, making it very difficult for it to close out stocks on its own. Squirtle's light weight and unimpressive recovery also make its endurance very poor, and it is no longer resistant to fire attacks due to the removal of type effectiveness, further hindering Squirtle's endurance in certain matchups. As previously mentioned, Squirtle has poor range throughout its attacks (save for its smash attacks), and it lacks a damaging projectile, making it very easy for Squirtle to be out-spaced by characters with superior range.

Squirtle's offstage game is also poor. While all of its aerial attacks can autocancel in a short hop, they are all very weak (barring neutral aerial) and do not KO reliably on their own, and lack range compared to other aerials. This flaw is further pronounced with the changes to meteor canceling due to Squirtle's very light weight, while it lacks a meteor smash of any kind unlike Squirtle and Charizard. Finally, while Withdraw works well as a recovery option, 50/50 option and mindgame tool, it has a unique flaw: if Squirtle is footstooled during the move's animation, it will be left unable to input any actions for 120 frames, leaving it extremely vulnerable both in the air and on the ground, requiring caution when using the move.

Overall, Squirtle should mainly be used to quickly rack up damage with its strong combo game while it and its opponents are at lower percents, and Squirtle should be swapped out with Squirtle or Charizard to close out the opponent's stock and to survive for longer.</p>
