<h1>Olimar</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Olimar is a small, floaty, lightweight character with disjointed attacks. He has the 33rd slowest dashing speed, 8th worst air speed, 32nd highest air acceleration (tied with Duck Hunt and Inkling, among others), very low gravity, low traction (tied with Diddy Kong), below-average falling speed, and above-average jump height. Due to these attributes, Olimar has below-average mobility for the most part.

What sets Olimar apart from a majority of the cast is that his stronger attacks do not come from him. Instead, he utilizes Pikmin to perform disjointed attacks and function as projectiles to attack opponents from a distance during his smash attacks, most of his aerials, and side special move. Olimar starts off with 3 Pikmin at the start of each battle, and can have up to 3 at any given point. Each Pikmin has their own hit points, and will die if they take too much damage or fall into the blast zone. Pikmin are obtained in a specific order: Red, Yellow, Blue, White and Purple, then cycling back to Red. Winged Pikmin also appear via Olimar's up special move, although they lack hurtboxes and hit points like the other Pikmin.

Pikmin Pluck, Olimar's neutral special move, enables him to gain Pikmin when used on any solid surface in the event he has less than 3 Pikmin available. It's very laggy when used in air, but is somewhat quick on the ground and is best used if spaced out. Pikmin Order, Olimar's down special move, can be used to quickly call all Pikmin back. It also grants super armor during its first few frames, although this can be pretty risky to use as a strictly defense measure due to the super armor's minimal amount of frames.

Winged Pikmin, Olimar's up special move, is a very flexible recovery option. The Winged Pikmin can be moved freely around the air, and their travel can be canceled with an aerial attack. However, canceling the Winged Pikmin will render Olimar helpless. Additionally, consecutive usage of the Winged Pikmin will tire them out, which results in their travel distance and maneuverability both worsening. Although sporadic usage of the Winged Pikmin will prevent them from tiring out, their travel distance and maneuverability will still worsen depending on Olimar's lineup of Pikmin: Purple Pikmin are the heaviest, whereas White Pikmin are the lightest.

His primary damage-racking move and an excellent utility move is his side special, Pikmin Throw. Olimar throws his Pikmin forward. The thrown Pikmin, except for Purple, cling the target and deal elemental damage over time. Purple Pikmin don't cling to opponents and instead deal a single strong hit as they are in the air. If they don't land on a target, they become miniature, independent hurtboxes that run back toward Olimar. When clinging to the opponent, they can be killed or damaged by certain moves, such as a down smash that covers the user in a hitbox. However, this can be used to an advantage, as the Pikmin can be used to block certain moves such as Charge Shot, even when clinging to Samus.

Each Pikmin has different properties that both affect how they interact with moves and the Olimar's attacks. Red Pikmin have average projectile range, deal the second-highest damage, have the fire effect, and are immune to fire attacks. Yellow Pikmin have an arcing path with slightly lower range, have the electric effect, have a larger hitbox (â‰ˆ50% larger compared to the other Pikmin), and are immune to electric attacks. Blue Pikmin have average projectile range, higher throw power and damage, have the water effect, and are immune to water attacks. White Pikmin have the longest projectile range, deal the least direct damage in exchange for the most cling damage, and have the darkness effect. Purple Pikmin have the shortest projectile range, but deal the most damage and knockback and do not cling to opponents but act as a standard projectile with knockback instead.

Neutral attack is a one-two combo that is quick overall, yet is best suited only for low percent set-ups into down tilt, a grab, and Pikmin Throw or if used for jab locking. Forward tilt is a wind-up punch that is laggy overall and his slowest tilt attack. However, it possesses respectable power that makes it useful for creating space and, more notably, it is his only non-Pikmin attack that can KO at reasonable percents. Up tilt is a simple spinning hop that is best suited as an anti-air move, yet can also set be followed up with an up aerial at low percents if the opponent fails to DI properly. Down tilt is Olimar's most useful tilt attack: it is a lunging tackle that can start combos at varying percents, function as a pseudo-crawl, and is his best spacing option in most scenarios thanks to its quick start-up.

Olimar's aerials have great utility despite his mediocre air speed. His forward and back aerials are great for edgeguarding thanks to their wide arc. His up aerial is effective for juggling and combos, whereas his down aerial can meteor smash in its earlier frames while still possessing a weaker lingering hitbox in its later frames, thus making it a solid tool for denying juggles. Olimar's neutral aerial is his only aerial that does not utilize Pikmin, and thus has much less range in comparison. However, it still has some utility as a niche combo tool and landing option. Furthermore, using Olimar's Pikmin-based aerials can enable him to cycle through his lineup to use a favorable Pikmin for his next attack.

Olimar's throws are disproportionately powerful for a character of his size, specifically while using blue Pikmin. Up throw is a reliable kill move above approximately 130% with blue Pikmin (having very high base knockback) and can potentially set up juggling scenarios, while down throw reliably combos into forward aerial at low to medium percents and Pikmin Throw at higher percents, meaning that he can get very large amounts of damage off of a grab. Forward throw has very little kill power, with its main usage being gaining stage control and sending opponents offstage. Back throw follows much the same idea, but has the ability to kill with blue Pikmin. (Note: Blue Pikmin drastically increase the knockback and damage of throws. White Pikmin increase the range of the grab itself, while Purple Pikmin lower grab range. Other Pikmin have no effect on throws.)

Having relatively long range for a character of his size also makes Olimar great at camping out and approaching hand-to-hand combatants, such as Captain Falcon or Wario, and further accentuate his strong punishment game. All of Olimar's aforementioned qualities give him a strong damage racking capability to complement his zoning focused playstyle.

However, Olimar does have some noticeable weaknesses to counterbalance his strengths. One of his most noteworthy issues is his defenselessness without his Pikmin. Although they can be plucked rather quickly, he can only do so when on the ground and there is still enough time to punish Olimar if he doesn't secure his space before gaining more Pikmin. His physical attacks themselves also provide niche/situational utility compared to his Pikmin moves and have significantly less range. Therefore, he is at his greatest disadvantage if the opponent manages to keep him airborne and within his space due to the very short range and limited scope of his physical attacks. On the flipside, his recovery becomes noticeably worsened when he does have Pikmin; as a result, he may have to resort to casting them aside if it improves his chances of recovering safely, and thus ridding himself of major defenses.

Olimar's below-average dashing and air speeds also make him susceptible to rushdown-oriented fighters overwhelming him while he's in a disadvantage state. This, in turn, is further compounded by his aforementioned difficulty at escaping a disadvantage state without Pikmin. Finally, Olimar's zoning capabilities are severely hindered by characters with a reflector, as Olimar's side special is both a projectile and his primary damage-racking move. On top of that, all of Olimar's smash attacks do damage solely through the use of Pikmin as projectiles, making a reflected smash attack potentially deadly, even at lower percents.

Overall, Olimar is a versatile zoner who has an unorthodox manner of fighting involving the management of his Pikmin. Due to his poor disadvantage and his need for careful cycling and management of his Pikmin, he generally can't afford to be reckless in his play.</p>
