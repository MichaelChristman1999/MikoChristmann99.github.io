<h1>Pit</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Pit is a middleweight who has above-average walking and dashing speeds, a fast initial dash, very high traction (being tied with his Echo Fighter for the 2nd highest behind Sonic), average air acceleration and falling speed, and below-average air speed and gravity. Pit's jump and double jump are both low, although this flaw is largely offset by his 3 double jumps. These attributes collectively render Pit's overall mobility as average, yet make him adept at adapting to most situations. Unlike most of his fellow middleweights, Pit also has above-average height.

As a beginner-friendly character, Pit has a low learning curve, yet is quite rewarding when played wisely. His ease of use is probably best exemplified by his fast frame data; aside from six moves (forward tilt, forward smash, and forward/back/up/down aerials), the rest of Pit's standard moveset has less than 10 frames of startup lag. Much like his attributes, Pit's moveset is balanced, so much so that it seemingly has no glaring strengths or weaknesses. When coupled with his great neutral game, Pit's edgeguarding potential, punishment ability, and conversions are all balanced compared to the rest of the cast. Pit's ground game overall possesses a decent level of utility. Neutral attack, down tilt and down smash are decent spacing options, thanks to their quick start-up and moderate ending lag in proportion to their range, with down tilt also serving as a useful combo starter unlike in SSB4 in addition to making Pit pseudo-crawl.

Neutral attack's first two hits can jab lock, while dash attack can punish landings and whiffed attacks very effectively, and down smash's back hit is a moderately strong semi-spike. Up tilt and especially up smash are useful anti-air moves, with the former being viable for setting up juggles even at higher percentages, while the latter also boasts enough power to score KOs. Lastly, forward smash is Pit's strongest KOing option, and also has among the fastest startup of any forward smash in the game.

Pit possesses a respectable grab game. Forward throw can combo into dash attack at low percentages or KO at high percentages while near the edge, while down throw can be used to combo into up smash or his aerials. Back throw can be used to setup edgeguards at higher percentages, but otherwise has limited utility. Finally, up throw is Pit's most damaging, yet least useful throw, since its only utility is to occasionally set up juggles or pressure.

Pit's air game is also useful, thanks to his aerial attacks' ability to all autocancel in a short hop and their particular strengths. Neutral aerial has the lowest amount of startup lag out of his entire moveset, a long duration, and an excellent autocancel window. Altogether, these traits make it a decent out of shield option, decent for edgeguarding and approaching, and similarly to Palutena's neutral aerial, it is also useful for pressure and combos. Forward and up aerials are reliable followups from down throw, the latter more so at mid to high percentages; in addition, the former is useful for approaching and edgeguarding, whereas the latter is excellent for juggling. Back aerial is Pit's strongest aerial attack when sweetspotted, making it ideal for spacing as well as for outright KOing. Lastly, down aerial is has the lowest ending lag of Pit's aerials, and is useful for edgeguarding thanks to it being a meteor smash during its first frame, and its fairly large range also makes it decent for approaching; the inability to tech grounded meteor smashes in Ultimate also enables down aerial to serve as a combo starter at higher percents that can combo into an up smash for a reliable KO combo. It's also fast for a meteor smash, coming out on frame 10. Pit's aerial attacks also have low landing lag.

Pit's special moves are fairly versatile as well, reinforcing his ease of use. He has a great projectile in Palutena Bow which can be charged and easily maneuvered makes it very useful for camping, edgeguarding, winning projectile wars against characters such as Simon, and even mindgames. Upperdash Arm functions very similarly to Raptor Boost: it propels Pit forward and, upon making contact with something, results in him throwing an uppercut that has a decent damage output and very high base knockback, and can KO at high percentages. Upperdash Arm also has utility outside of offense; it grants super armor, can reflect projectiles, and can function as a horizontal recovery option. However, it is very punishable because of its dash's noticeable startup lag and extreme amount of ending lag, especially when it misses. Upperdash Arm's deflection property is also fairly inconsequential, since it reflects projectiles at an upward diagonal angle instead of directly back at the opponent. Power of Flight covers an impressive amount of distance, and be angled to propel Pit either vertically, diagonally, or almost horizontally; it also grants Pit brief intangibility on startup as well. Lastly, Guardian Orbitars protect Pit on his left and right sides with energy shields that reflect projectiles. They are also capable of pushing opponents back, which makes them capable of edgeguarding. However, the Orbitars are not indestructible: should they end up being destroyed, they cannot be used again for 10 seconds. In addition, their high amount of ending lag makes them highly risky when used on the ground or when landing.

Despite his strengths, Pit does have some weaknesses. Like any all-around character, most characters are able to outperform him in various areas: as examples, Mario himself has a significantly more versatile combo game, Fox has better mobility, Olimar and Snake are better at camping, Shulk has much greater range, and R.O.B. has much stronger attacks. Pit's KO potential, however, is his most noticeable weakness, despite being buffed in the transition to Ultimate. Despite possessing a serviceable amount of KOing options, only his forward smash and up smash are consistently effective, and even these are highly unsafe on shield due to their high ending lag. In comparison, his other KOing options are only effective when sweetspotted (forward tilt and back aerial), or above 130% (dash attack, down aerial, down smash, forward throw and Upperdash Arm). This, in turn, is further compounded by his lack of guaranteed KO setups outside of sweetspotted down aerial into up smash.

Although rage somewhat alleviates Pit's KO potential, his average endurance means that he cannot utilize it as consistently or effectively as heavier characters can. As a result, Pit will typically spend a comparatively longer time racking up damage before attempting to score a KO, and will often give the opponent high amounts of rage in the process.

Although all of Pit's aerials autocancel in a short hop, only his forward and back aerials autocancel during a short hop buffered fast fall. This means that Pit players will often need to manually delay their fast fall perfectly in order to use his aerials effectively.

Pit's slow air speed, average falling speed and low gravity make him somewhat floaty and he noticeably struggles to both land and contest other aerial opponents due to neutral air and forward air's small looping hitboxes, with the former being only capable of hitting opponents very close to him, and the latter's first two hits don't fully cover the blade as it spins, and they are both poor defensively due to their lack of range. In the end, Pit's aerials are helpful in his advantage state and supplement his grounded neutral game, but are much less useful when he is disadvantaged. To make this issue even worse, he has only one aerial which comes out before frame 10, which is his frame 4 neutral aerial, while his back, up, and down aerials come out on frame 10, and his forward aerial at frame 11, being the slowest startup of his entire moveset. Due to aerials that are slow, are unable to properly cover him, and his floaty nature, Pit is vulnerable to pressure, as he lacks reliable ways to escape pressure or to defend himself from juggles. While his down aerial is overall fast, especially for a meteor smash, and has good range, he cannot be overly reliant on that to get out of disadvantage, and Palutena Bow, while versatile, needs a long time to be used effectively. This gives Pit a poor disadvantage state overall.

Although long-distanced, Pit's recovery is linear and predictable, and Power of Flight also does not provide Pit with protective hitboxes around him either while its intangibility period is very brief, which can leave him vulnerable to sufficiently strong meteor smashes. Additionally, while Upperdash Arm can aid Pit's horizontal recovery, it has an extreme amount of ending lag when performed in the air, making it extremely risky when improperly used as a recovery option.

All in all, Pit's strengths are on par with his weaknesses. His moveset consists of many moves with long range (his grounded moves and back aerial), long durations (neutral/forward/up aerials and forward tilt), low ending lag (autocanceled neutral/forward aerials, down smash and Palutena Bow) or quick movement (dash attack, dash grab and Upperdash Arm). This combination of traits, along with his good grounded mobility, allows Pit to reliably keep opponents in a disadvantage state, either stuck trying to land or getting off the edge.

In the end, this is arguably Pit's saving grace: he can cover enough options and retain advantage long enough to rack up more damage than a character of his limited combo potential should. However, he suffers from unimpressive KO potential similarly to lightweights, yet lacks the extended combo options and safe pressuring options that they typically possess for damage-racking. Conversely, Pit also has a poor disadvantage state like many heavyweights, yet his overall damage output is considerably lower than most of theirs. As a result, Pit's pros are on par with his cons.

Despite being a very balanced character, players often tend to overlook Pit in favor of other characters that possess much more outstanding strengths than he does. This has also been reflected in his tournament representation, which is minimal outside of Japan, much like in SSB4. However, Pit has nevertheless managed to achieve an adequate level of success in the competitive scene, although not as much as in SSB4: Kuro in particular has done well with Pit, with him placing 3rd at Umebura SP. Pit has also received results from others like KiraFlax.</p>
