<h1>Pyra</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Pyra is the stronger Blade of the Aegis duo, possessing vastly superior KO potential, damage output and overall range. Like Mythra, Pyra is a middleweight, albeit on the heavier side of the weight class (weighing the same as Mario, Dr. Mario, and Corrin). Despite her weight class, Pyra is burdened with very slow mobility: aside from her above-average air speed, she has the 6th slowest dashing speed, below-average walking speed, and slightly below-average air acceleration. However, compared to other fighters in and around her weight class, her overall character type is similar to that of traditional heavyweights thanks to her plethora of hard-hitting attacks.

While Pyra's power is perhaps her most dominant strength, her range is also very formidable. As a swordswoman who fights with her respective Aegis Sword, almost all of Pyra's standard attacks (barring the first hit of neutral attack) are disjointed, aiding her in directly challenging incoming attacks. This also means that with proper spacing, her aerial moves are hard to punish on shield at maximum distance, allowing her to easily break shields with simple air-to-ground combos. However, Pyra's range also means that with her forward smash, which is one of the longest-reaching in the game, she can bypass counterattacks more effectively than most other characters at maximum distance.

The majority of Pyra's offensive utility comes from her grounded moveset. Her neutral attack comes out on frame 3, making it her fastest attack overall as well as a decent close-range pressure option. Despite dealing less damage than other heavyweight non-infinite jabs, her jab combo is very strong overall, being able to KO starting at 195% from the center of Final Destination. Her forward tilt has very good coverage in front of her and has strong KO potential, while her up tilt hits all around her and KOs very early at 130% from ground level, while also having surprisingly low end lag for its power. While her down tilt is her weakest tilt attack, its speed enables it to work as a poking option and combo tool, while it also hits low enough to hit certain characters hanging on edges. Her smash attacks are her primary finishers, while they all share a balance of range and power; her forward smash is surprisingly fast for its power and range at only 20 frames of startup, while it can KO as early as 75% from center stage uncharged. Her up smash is similar to Lucas's equivalent move in that it has a very good range overall along with equally strong KO power. Her down smash is her weakest smash attack, although also her fastest, and unlike other "sweeping" down smashes, provides excellent coverage in front and behind due to hitting both sides at once for both hits.

Pyra's aerial game also provides other offensive options. Her neutral aerial, despite its slow startup, hits all around her much like Ike's equivalent move, and can KO starting at 155% from ground level. Her forward aerial is very fast despite her generally slow frame data and has roughly the same KO power as her neutral aerial. Her back aerial covers a very wide arc behind her and KOs extremely early at 115% from ground level despite its vertical knockback, allowing it to be used as a niche (albeit slow) option if used in a reverse aerial rush. Her up aerial hits in a very wide arc above her and autocancels in a full hop, while her down aerial is a meteor smash that can KO and start combos, being able to lead into KO confirms depending on the opponent's weight and falling speed.

Lastly, Pyra has an overall versatile set of special moves apart from her down special. Flame Nova, her neutral special, acts a spinning move much like the Links' Spin Attacks, in that it hits in front in behind and can be charged for more damage. Blazing End, her side special, is a projectile that functions like the Links' respective Boomerangs, dealing damage while moving forward (although it cannot move vertically). Prominence Revolt, her up special, is similar to Stone Scabbard, being a rise-then-fall attack that acts as her recovery option, while it works exceptionally well as an out of shield option due to its range and power, and can sweetspot edges on the way up. Lastly, her down special, Swap, switches her with Mythra while granting some invincibility during the switch, allowing to switch playstyles on the fly.

However, Pyra has glaring flaws that are enough to balance out her range and power. As mentioned earlier, her overall mobility is very slow to compensate for her large, powerful attacks. Despite her long range, said speed ironically renders her approach limited even against characters with less range, such as Pit and Sonic, and even other weapon wielders like Joker (especially with his own dashing speed). This also translates thoroughly into her moveset, as while her moves are more frame-flexible than other similar characters such as Ganondorf, they are still punishable due to their high end lag, meaning that a single mistake can easily allow opponents to get close to her.

Her special moves also carry certain flaws as well. Flame Nova has some considerable startup (unless uncharged), while the move does not protect her from above, meaning that characters with good aerial mobility and frame data (such as Falco) can easily approach her with little risk, making the move unsafe if used repeatedly. Blazing End puts Pyra in a state where she is unable to use any other moves until the Aegis Sword returns to her hand, during which she will briefly enter a 20-frame state where she will stop in place. This is especially exploitable with characters that have powerful throws or moves that send her far offstage where the sword may not return to Pyra in time to transform into Mythra for recovery. Lastly, Prominence Revolt has very little horizontal distance potential (only traveling a set horizontal distance of half the length of Battlefield's platform); this when combined with the move's mainly vertical recovery angle makes the move likely to self-destruct if Pyra is too far from the ledge. It also cannot sweetspot ledges from behind leading to a self-destruct if she doesn't reverse the move when facing away from the ledge. Because of this, her sole way of recovery is to use her aerial mobility to make it to just above or below the edge before using Prominence Revolt. Moreover, Prominence Revolt's descent also has a significantly weaker meteor smash than similar moves such as Aether, making the move easier to challenge directly and ill-suited for attempting sacrificial KOs.

Pyra also has a poor disadvantage state, as her average weight, frame size and below-average frame data make her susceptible to combos, while she lacks safe options for interrupting enemy combos. This means that she is also very vulnerable to high-damage combos that end with semi-spikes, as the damage accumulated may be enough for the finishing blow to keep her sufficiently away from the ledge. This is further exacerbated with Prominence Revolt's aforementioned low horizontal distance. Although Swap enables Mythra to remedy the latter flaw somewhat, it is not a failsafe strategy: unlike Pok√©mon Change, Swap does not grant intangibility until frame 6, making it inefficient as a combo breaker, while Mythra's recovery options are also somewhat mediocre all around despite her vastly superior aerial mobility.

Lastly, Pyra has an overall weak grab game. While her pummel is tied with other characters as the third-most damaging in Ultimate, her throws are overall weak with limited utility (especially her back throw), with only her forward throw dealing more than 8%. Her forward throw can KO at very high percentages at the edge, her up throw can position opponents for KO setups with poor DI/react time, and her down throw can force the opponent into unfavorable aerial positions, where she can follow up if the opponent does not properly react while being able to KO after 200%. However, since said throws are not as powerful as traditional KO throws, they are instead best used to position or edgeguard opponents.

Overall, Pyra is a hard-hitting, yet surprisingly versatile swordswoman who excels at punishing. She must be patient to look for openings due to her slow mobility and poor disadvantage state. In addition, Pyra is best utilized when she and Mythra have the advantage so as to alleviate their respective weaknesses and amplify their respective strengths, whereas it is considered best to switch to her counterpart to keep advantage due to Mythra's sheer flexibility and vastly superior movement.

Not too long after they were released, professional players such as MkLeo, Sparg0 and Shuton have demonstrated very strong results with Pyra both online and offline alongside her counterpart Mythra, and their representation and results have further expanded since then. Although Pyra and Mythra's shared viability when used together remains unclear in the long term, most players believe they are top tier or even among the best characters in the game, alongside the commonly accepted Pikachu and Joker.</p>
