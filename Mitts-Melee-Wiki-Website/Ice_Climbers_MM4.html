<h1>Ice Climbers</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>The Ice Climbers are a pair of middleweights (weighing the same as Lucario, Wolf, Villager, Mythra, and Steve) that are the archetypical tag team characters, though each Climber is a unique character in their own right. The partner (Nana, by default) has higher mobility attributes (walking, dashing, air and fall speeds, gravity, and air acceleration), but at the same time takes more damage and knockback than the leader (Popo, by default). Another unique trait that the partner possesses is their forward aerial's ability to meteor smash. Due to technically being two characters, the Ice Climbers are able to grab two different items. Unlike in previous installments, they are no longer hard to grab and throw unless the partner is the one being grabbed (when the leader is grabbed, the partner will panic). When separated, AI takes control of the partner, and guides them back to the leader. In this scenario, it is advisable to stick to and protect the partner. Should the CPU Climber get KO'd during the stock, the remaining Climber will have drastically reduced damage output, KO ability, and recovery, with Belay becoming practically useless and Squall Hammer losing a good deal of distance (whereas with both Climbers they are excellent recovery moves).

The Ice Climbers are great at dealing damage when together, have decent attack speed, and possess a few interesting attacks in their arsenal. Their neutral special move, Ice Shot, is a projectile fired by each Ice Climber which slides along the ground, making it impossible to avoid by crouching/crawling, though it can damage the Climbers themselves if the blocks are attacked. Blizzard, their down special move, can freeze opponents and has both Ice Climbers attacking one side whether on the ground or in midair. Squall Hammer is a decent approach attack with good damage and speed, spinning the Ice Climbers around each other in a forward-moving hammer attack. By mashing the button, they can gain a little height, making it a potential recovery option (albeit not an effective one). Belay, the up special, is a powerful KO move (though not as powerful as in Brawl) should the second Climber connect with the opponent, but it is generally a risky use of the move given that it separates the Climbers and puts them into a helpless animation. It is much more suited for recovery, as well as for saving the separated partner from falling offstage. Although minor, the Ice Climbers nevertheless have a unique fighter ability: their traction is not affected by the conditions of slippery surfaces such as ice, whereas they will slide somewhat on non-slippery surfaces.

One of the Ice Climbers' greatest weakness is their dependability on each other. While having decent damage output and KO potential, it becomes horribly diminished if the partner is KO'd, and the fact that the partner takes more damage and knockback further compounds this problem. When separated, while the AI guides the partner back to the leader, the partner is unable to act and defend themself from any other threats. Because of this, it is important for the leader to hurry back to the partner, though this can potentially lead the leader into dangerous situations as well.

Their main recovery method, Belay, is incredibly situational. If the partner is unable to reach the ledge, then it can put the leader at a disadvantage even if they make it back to the stage. Since the partner flings the leader much higher, it is possible to overshoot the ledge, leaving the leader unable to defend themselves while descending helplessly onstage.</p>
