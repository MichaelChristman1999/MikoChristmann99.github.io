<h1>Wii Fit Trainer</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Wii Fit Trainer is a somewhat tall middleweight. She possesses a fast walking speed (the 24th highest), slightly above average dashing speed, a fast initial dash, average air speed, high air acceleration (tied for the 21st highest), high jumps, average gravity, has the 11th highest traction and is tied with Isabelle and the Ice Climbers for the 7th-9th slowest falling speed. In addition, she has one of the longest tech rolls and ledge rolls in the game, which can make her hard to punish even if a roll is expected. These attributes give her overall good mobility, although, similarly to Luigi and Pit, Wii Fit Trainer is somewhat floaty for her weight class, and is one of the floatiest characters in the game. She can also wall jump and crawl, with the latter being one of the shortest in terms of hurtbox height, making it useful defensively.

Wii Fit Trainer possesses a great damage-racking game through several attacks that deal unusually high damage, most notably her neutral aerial and Header. Additionally, her Deep Breathing makes her faster, stronger, and more durable for a few seconds, further increasing her damage output. Many of Wii Fit Trainer's attacks also have unusual hitbox placements or properties, such as hitting on both sides of her. For example, her forward tilt can hit in front of her with her arm and behind her with her leg; this also applies to forward smash, forward aerial, and the first hit of her neutral attack. The final hit of her neutral attack also has a sweetspot that buries opponents.

Wii Fit Trainer also has two strong projectiles, Sun Salutation and Header. The former can be charged, with the fully charged version dealing high damage, good knockback, and healing her by 2%. The latter is very versatile, with several different common uses. Not only can it combo into many of her attacks, but it can also be used as a long-lasting and large meteor smash, a way to both enter advantage and exit disadvantage, a virtually infinite pool of mixups and setups with Header cancels, and even a recovery tool since it gives Wii Fit Trainer slight upward momentum when used in the air, allowing for stalling and greater horizontal movement.

Wii Fit Trainer also possesses a great air game. With the exception of her back aerial, she can autocancel all of her aerials in a short hop, with neutral aerial and forward aerial even being fast enough to squeeze a back aerial in before landing. Neutral aerial consists of two hits, with the first hit having hitboxes on her arms and legs that lead into the centralized second hit, dealing a total of 14% base damage if both hits connect. This is one of her best combo starters and extenders due to its low lag, low knockback, and 90Â° launch angle. Because of this, a well placed neutral aerial can easily lead to 70% combos or even extremely early KOs with setups such as neutral aerial's first hit to up smash.

Forward aerial has good power, fast startup, and very little ending lag, with extremely favorable autocancel windows. It also has a hitbox on Wii Fit Trainer's foot which serves as a weak but quick meteor smash, being one of the fastest in the game at frame 9. Back aerial is her fastest aerial in terms of the startup, coming out on frame 5, but is also her strongest, possessing a small sweet spot on her feet on the first active frame that has very high knockback. Up aerial has decent knockback and is good for juggling, with a surprisingly large disjoint that can often beat out opponents landing aggressively. Down aerial is a powerful meteor smash with exceptional hitboxes; the sweetspot covers more than half of the Wii Fit Trainer's body with no initial sour spot. In addition, down aerial has fairly low ending and landing lag, making it relatively safe on shield along with neutral and forward aerial.

Wii Fit Trainer generally fights well in both long-range and close-quarters combat due to her strong projectiles and hard-hitting normals, but struggles at mid-range as a result of her lack of range on her tilts and aerials. As such, the character sometimes has trouble approaching, and typically relies on Header to do so. Wii Fit Trainer has some of the most punishing combos in the game when it comes to damage, but getting close enough to the opponent to start a powerful combo can sometimes prove difficult, especially when the opponent can easily deal with Header, such as Pocket.

Wii Fit Trainer notably excels both offstage and on the ledge. While neither of these areas is where she wants to be necessarily, she has several tools that give her more options than the average character in these scenarios. The most important of these tools is Header, as it can cover Wii Fit Trainer's recovery, as well as stall her in the air or cover ledge options. Due to the character's below-average airspeed and slow fall speed (without Deep Breathing), she can sometimes struggle to land safely. She also possesses three different meteor smashes: Header, down aerial and forward aerial's foot hitbox, which all support Wii Fit Trainer's potent edgeguarding ability.

Wii Fit Trainer's grab game is serviceable, with both forward throw at low percents and especially up throw at mid percents offering some combo potential. Down throw is often used at low percents as well, however, the throw has no true followups on the majority of the cast. Despite several options for combo throws, Wii Fit Trainer lacks a solid KO throw; although back throw is her strongest throw, it typically doesn't KO until well past 140%, and thus requires Deep Breathing to alleviate this flaw.

Wii Fit Trainer's smash attacks are all rather volatile, as they possess high risk for high reward. All three moves are far above average in strength, especially up smash, which is one of the strongest up smashes in the game when connecting the sweet spot at her hands even without Deep Breathing. The move's solid vertical range, quick startup, and 4 frames of full-body intangibility also make it a good anti-air tool. Forward smash is a solid punishing tool since it hits on both sides of Wii Fit Trainer with a large horizontal range, which can also be used to catch landings. The move's main weakness is its notable blind spot directly below Wii Fit Trainer's arms. Down smash is a semi-spike that hits on both sides of Wii Fit Trainer simultaneously, and is her only smash attack that can consistently cover the area close to the ground.

Despite her smash attacks' strengths, these moves also come with the downside of large amounts of ending lag, making them extremely punishable when missed. Although Wii Fit Trainer has several strong attacks, she sometimes has trouble taking stocks, as many of her KO moves are hard to land or are inconsistent, such as forward tilt and back air's poor hitboxes, with the former's large blind spots on both the front and back hits and the latter's sweetspot only lasting for one frame. In addition, forward aerial typically cannot cover the space directly in front of or behind the Wii Fit Trainer. All these inconsistencies add up, leaving Wii Fit Trainer with few truly reliable kills moves, although this weakness was somewhat remedied in update 8.0.0 when both down tilt and Sun Salutation became markedly better at KOing opponents.

Due to her unorthodox moveset, relatively steep learning curve, and lack of the mass appeal that many fighters possess, Wii Fit Trainer has a fairly small playerbase. However, she has received much more attention in Ultimate than in Smash 4, since her overall viability has been greatly improved. It remains to be seen how she will fare in the long run of Ultimate's competitive scene.</p>
