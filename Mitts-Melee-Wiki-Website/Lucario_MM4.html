<h1>Lucario</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>In terms of physical attributes, Lucario is a middleweight fighter (same weight as Ice Climbers, Mythra, Steve, Wolf, and Villager, making it on the lower end of middleweights) with average height, a below-average walking speed and an average running speed, a very fast initial dash (tied for 5th fastest with Bowser, Mewtwo, Marth, and Lucina), above-average traction, very high air speed (6th fastest in this category), above-average air acceleration and falling speed, and below-average gravity; Lucario can also crawl, wall jump, and wall cling. These traits make Lucario a somewhat floaty character who can maintain aerial presence for a long time, be it onstage or offstage, while also having decent mobility and control on the ground due to its fast dashing speed and above-average traction; collectively, Lucario's overall mobility meanders between average and above-average.

Lucario's most notable strength comes from its unique fighter ability, Aura, in which damage and knockback multipliers are applied to all of its attacks depending on how much damage Lucario has taken, with the multipliers being directly proportional to its percent; the multiplier is x0.66 at 0%, increases to x1.0 (base power) at 65%, and caps out at 190% with a multiplier of x1.67. Aura multipliers are also affected by differences in stocks, with it increasing when Lucario is behind in stocks and decreasing when it is ahead. Additionally, Aura also affects the properties of its special moves; as Aura increases, the size of Aura Sphere becomes larger when charging and when fired, the blast from Force Palm has greater range, and Extreme Speed travels a greater distance. In turn, this ability can allow Lucario to rack up large amounts of damage and kill at very early percents when it has taken a lot of damage, making it useful as a comeback mechanic when Lucario is falling behind. It should be noted that Aura also stacks with rage, further augmenting the increased knockback of Lucario's moves at very high percents, though to a lesser extent than in the previous game.

In terms of its grounded moveset, while its neutral attack has little to no use due to having low damage output relative to its speed, dealing only 9% at base power despite coming out at frame 5 (for reference, faster jabs such as Mario's come out frame 2 and deal 8% while slower jabs such as Bayonetta's come out frame 9 and deal 21%) its other grounded moves have some utility; forward tilt has its use as a spacing tool due its ability to be angled and kills middleweights at 145% on the edge of Final Destination at base power, up tilt is a combo starter that can combo into itself at low percents and into neutral aerial, forward aerial, and up aerial at mid percents, down tilt can combo into dash attack and forward aerial at mid percents while also having its use as a spacing tool, and dash attack, while not being very useful for killing, is a decent burst option due to it coming out fast as well as because of its fast initial dash.

Its smash attacks also have their uses as disjointed kill options. Up smash has its use as an anti-air that kills middleweights at 105% at base power and it can also hit grounded opponents up close with its initial scooping hitbox, making it a situational out of shield option against laggy moves. Down smash covers Lucario from both sides and kills middleweights at 115% from center stage at base power. Forward smash has the greatest amount of kill power and horizontal range out of its smash attacks, being able to kill middleweights at 90% from center stage at base power while also having the potential to be safe on shield if spaced well. Its grab game also has utility. Up throw and down throw can be used as combo starters, with the former being able to combo into forward aerial at low percents and neutral aerial at mid percents (as well as up aerial on bigger characters), while the latter can combo into forward aerial at low percents (with down throw > forward air > forward air > up air being its most damaging combo at low percents). Forward throw and back throw don't have much use outside of being positional throws, though the latter can have a situational use as a late kill throw.

Lucario's aerial moveset also has good utility. Neutral aerial hits twice, covers Lucario from both sides and has a good amount of active frames, making it a useful edgeguarding tool that compliments its ability to maintain aerial presence. It can also combo into up tilt, down tilt, and dash attack at low and mid percents when SHFF'd. Forward aerial is fast and can combo into itself when SHFF'd, up aerial and back aerial are vertical and horizontal kill options, with the former killing middleweights at 110% at base power near the top blast zone and having situational combo potential into itself and neutral aerial when SHFF'd, and the the latter kills at 115% from base power at center stage while also being slightly disjointed. Down aerial is also unique in its uses; it is its fastest aerial at frame 4, allowing it to be an out of shield option, it stalls its movements which allows it to mix up its disadvantage and edgeguarding, and it has its use as a kill option, killing middleweights at 135% from the edge of Final Destination at base power.

Lucario's special moveset sports great versatility as well. Aura Sphere is useful as a projectile and as a kill option, with a fully charged one killing middleweights at 150% from center stage at base power. In addition, the move also maintains a hitbox behind Lucario as it is being charged, giving it use as an approach mixup and sometimes as a situational kill confirm into back aerial. Force Palm is unique in the fact that it functions as a ranged blast from a distance and as a command grab at point blank range, giving it use as an out of shield option and a kill option, as it kills middleweights at 140% at base power from center stage. Extreme Speed, being its primary recovery option, travels a good distance and has a hitbox that enables it to be used as a mixup for onstage recoveries. Finally, Double Team is a counter that has greater utility than conventional counters; the distance the move covers allows Lucario to punish the opponent when countering a projectile, and the fact that the strength of the counter is based on Aura as opposed to the strength of the countered move allows it to kill middleweights at 115% at base power regardless of the move being countered.

All in all, these traits give Lucario a decent neutral game with Aura Sphere, good advantage state, edgeguarding capabilities, and a decent disadvantage state with its fast air mobility and two specials that can be B-reversed and versatile special moves, as outside of Mewtwo, Lucario is the only character that has both a chargeable projectile that can be stored and a command grab in their special moveset, not to mention that Lucario is the only character who has a projectile that has a hitbox during its charging animation as well as a move that functions as both a command grab and a ranged attack with Force Palm. In addition, Aura gives Lucario the potential to take early stocks and to comeback from percent and stock deficits.

However, Lucario also has notable flaws. Ironically, a lot of its flaws come from its most notable strength, Aura, as the fluctuating nature of the ability makes it inconsistent in a few ways. One thing Aura makes inconsistent is how Lucario is rewarded for winning neutral; because Aura has a x0.66 multiplier, this means that Lucario starts off the match and fresh stocks as a character with extremely poor damage output, meaning that it will have to win neutral many times and/or maintain advantage really well just to rack up decent damage with little to no Aura all while the opponent can have an easier time closing those percent deficits due to not being burdened with a damage reducing multiplier. In addition to having the issue of being burdened by low Aura, it is also difficult for Lucario to make the most out of high Aura because Lucario's average weight makes it very unlikely for it to be alive at very high percents, much less at 190% for him to use the highest Aura multiplier of x1.67, and then losing a stock only becomes even worse because it puts Lucario back to being burdened by the x0.66 multiplier; this essentially means that Lucario is only at its strongest state when it is also at its most vulnerable state. Aura's inconsistency not only affects the consistency in which it can rack up damage, but also the consistency at which it can kill; the kill percents mentioned earlier are at base power when Lucario has already taken at least 65%, meaning that those kill percents are far higher when its Aura is lower, and while it can also kill at far lower percents with high Aura, the consistency of that is also hindered by its average weight. Another thing that Aura makes inconsistent is its combo game; while other characters have their bread and butter combos and kill confirms at certain percent ranges, Lucario's combos and confirms are far less consistent because the knockback of moves will keep fluctuating as Aura increases, making it so those combos at low and mid percents won't always land due to Aura giving moves too much knockback.

Outside of Aura's inconsistencies, another flaw Lucario has revolves around its frame data, as while it isn't as slow as characters like Ganondorf and King K. Rool, it is still somewhat sluggish; its jab (frame 5) and forward tilt (frame 12) are slow relative to other jabs and forward tilts while also having poor damage output and/or kill power unless it is at high Aura, all of its smash attacks come out at frame 15 or slower, and all of its aerials barring forward aerial and down aerial come out at frame 10 or slower, with such issues making its already inconsistent kill power even more inconsistent on top of the fact that its throws outside of Force Palm have very little kill power unless it is at high Aura. Its poor frame data also hinders its ability to approach, which is also worsened by its somewhat floaty nature.

Finally, Lucario's special moveset, despite being versatile, doesn't come without its flaws, as Force Palm has hitbox issues that cause the command grab to not be triggered when at close range, and Double Team can put Lucario deeper in disadvantage if used hastily. However, the most glaring flaw with its special moveset is its recovery; while Extreme Speed travels fast and covers good distance, the fact that it has 47 frames of startup makes it vulnerable to edgeguarding. Additionally, the move is also inconsistent due to not always grabbing the ledge as well as the fact that the speed and distance change with Aura, making it possible to overshoot its recovery and self destruct.

Overall, Lucario is a very high risk, high reward character. Essentially being most powerful when most vulnerable, players need to know when to play recklessly and when to play carefully. Either kill sooner and get killed sooner, or kill later and get killed later. Lucario's flaws outweigh its strengths; despite the strengths it has in its special moveset and in its aerial and offstage game as well as the potential to secure early stocks and comebacks with high Aura, the potency of these strengths are undermined by Aura's many inconsistencies and its damage reducing multiplier when at percents less than 65%. On top of that, its below-average frame data and its floaty nature make its approaches inconsistent and its recovery is exploitable due to its long start-up. It is primarily from Aura's inconsistencies that players consider Lucario to be a low-tier character who is poorly designed, with many players suggesting that the character need to be reworked entirely. Because of this, Lucario is not a popular character to use as a main, especially in high level competition.</p>
