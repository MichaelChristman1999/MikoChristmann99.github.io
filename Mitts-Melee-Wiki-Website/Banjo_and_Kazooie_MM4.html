<h1>Banjo and Kazooie</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Banjo & Kazooie, like Duck Hunt, are a tag team that fight together as if they were a singular fighter. Together, they are a heavyweight, and are tied with Snake and R.O.B. as the 18th heaviest fighter in the game. As Banjo handles the duo's walking, his walking speed is below-average, and his initial dash and traction values are among the worst in the game. Conversely, Kazooie handles the duo's dashing, in which she uses the Talon Trot to carry Banjo. In stark contrast to Banjo's walking speed, Kazooie's dashing speed is very fast; specifically, it is the 11th fastest in the game, which is nearly unrivaled among their fellow heavyweights.

Banjo is somewhat short for a heavyweight due to having a relatively average height. Like Wario, however, his hurtbox is fairly wide. Kazooie, however, lacks a hurtbox of any kind outside of the Talon Trot and up tilt; as a result, all standard attacks involving her are disjointed. Like Ridley and Charizard, Kazooie also grants the duo two midair jumps with her wings. Additionally, they have a fast falling speed, high gravity, slow air speed, and average air acceleration.

The majority of Banjo & Kazooie's grounded arsenal makes use of moves from their first two games, Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie. Banjo's Claw Swipe and Kazooie's Rat-a-Tat Rap comprise their neutral attack. The former serves as a 3-hit gentleman jab, while the latter is a standard rapid jab. It should be noted that the hitbox of Kazooie's jabs is large enough to sometimes hit opponents standing directly behind the duo. This can cause the opponent to be continually jabbed into the duo's rear, keeping them locked in the hitbox and causing both of the fighters to be slowly moved backwards, often amounting to extremely high percentages by the time they reach the edge of a platform. Their forward tilt, Beak Bayonet, is a quick stab with Kazooie's beak, functioning similarly to Ridley's forward tilt. It can be angled and has a respectable amount of disjointed range, especially for its speed, making it useful for stopping predictable or vulnerable approaches. Their up tilt, a powerful upward kick from Banjo as Kazooie lifts him up from underneath, is an original move, and functions similar to Pac-Man's up tilt. It has barely any hitbox towards the duo's front or rear, making it very situational, but it hits through most platforms and can be a reliable follow-up from down throw. Their down tilt, Beak Barge, is a low-to-the-ground slide that launches at a very low semi-spike angle, making it a very potent edgeguarding and tech-chasing option. Their dash attack, the Forward Roll, is very similar to Donkey Kong's dash attack, but has more kill power and has fewer active frames.

Complementing their versatile tilts, Banjo & Kazooie sport very useful smash attacks. Their forward smash is Breegull Bash, a slow but powerful, good-ranged move that highlights a comical maneuver in their home game. The duo's up smash is the Bill Drill, a spinning attack with Kazooie's beak that is fairly useful as an anti-aerial and out-of-shield option, and is a reliable follow up to the duo's burying down throw, as the move is deceptively fast with a 7 frame startup. Banjo & Kazooie's down smash is an original move, a wing-slam from Kazooie on both sides of them much like Ridley, albeit weaker and much faster, making it a useful tool for catching rolls. Notably, their forward and down smashes, especially the latter, have long-lasting hitboxes that slightly penetrate the stage, making them both deadly 2-framing tools at the ledge.

Their aerial moveset also combines old and new moves. The duo's neutral aerial is the Twirling Wing Whack, a multi-hitting circular wing spin from Kazooie that is functionally very similar to Ivysaur's and Piranha Plant's neutral aerials. This move has respectable amount of combo potential, as well as being an easy way of scoring KOs offstage against fulnerable opponents. Their forward aerial, an original move, is a slow but powerful haymaker punch from Banjo, much like Dr. Mario's and Ganondorf's forward aerials. The move's clean hit is almost always a guaranteed KO offstage; additionally, his hand is intangible during the active frames, making the move great for covering the duo's approach, pressuring shields and edgeguarding. Rat-a-Tat Rap makes a second appearance as a back aerial that hits three times, similarly to Ridley's forward aerial. This move has respectable power, and is a good out-of-shield option as well as a reliable (albeit unsafe due to its lag) KO option offstage. Banjo & Kazooie's up aerial is a two-hit move that has Kazooie close her wings together in a scissor motion that weakly launches opponents upwards, allowing the move to be chained into itself, but its awkward knockback direction combined with its weak power doesn't allow it much juggling or combo utility. Beak Buster makes an appearance as their down aerial; it is a stall-then-fall attack that meteor smashes opponents during its initial frames, and has a fairly large hitbox upon impacting the stage.

Banjo & Kazooie's special moves are fairly versatile as well. Their neutral special is Egg Firing / Breegull Blaster. Egg Firing, activated when the special button is tapped, sends blue eggs out of Kazooie's mouth that are affected by gravity in a similar manner to Mario's Fireball, and acts as their primary edgeguarding tool and gimping option; the move also briefly stalls the duo's aerial momentum when used in the air. Holding the special button causes the move to transition into Breegull Blaster, in which Banjo wields Kazooie like a gun as in Banjo-Tooie's first-person shooter segments, with low damage but faster and constant projectiles, all while being able to move and jump freely similar to holding items such as the completed Daybreak parts. This can be used to pressure enemies in a similar manner to Mega Man's neutral attack, and even start ladder combos, though because the move is a "mode" that takes a moment to be entered and exited, it is often difficult to use in close proximity. Wonderwing has Banjo charge forward while Kazooie shields him with her magic-infused wings. It does high damage and knockback if it connects within the first half of the distance it covers, and its full-body invincibility that lasts through the entirety of the hitbox's duration allows it to out-prioritize nearly every other move in the game (exceptions include grabs and command grabs such as Buster Wolf). Wonderwing's duration and the size of its hitbox also allows it to act as a fantastic 2-framing option on the edge, as the duo will run in place at the edge for some time. Wonderwing can be an easy and effective way to brute force an opponent out of projectile camping, though this may backfire if the opponent is baiting the move or otherwise ready for it. It also functions as an excellent recovery option with its horizontal speed and distance and does not induce helplessness either. However, the move runs on a limited stock of five golden feathers that are not replenished until Banjo & Kazooie are KO'd, so its usage must be carefully considered; additionally, despite crossing up shields, Wonderwing's high ending lag and long-lasting singular hitbox make it fairly unsafe in any case where the opponent can see it coming. Shock Spring Jump makes an appearance as their up special. It is a decent vertical recovery move that does not leave them helpless and preserves their midair jumps; it can be charged to increase its travel distance, and when used in the air, the Shock Spring Pad itself possesses a damaging hitbox that can be used to gimp some recoveries. Rear Egg, their down special, has Kazooie lay an explosive Grenade Egg behind them. It bounces in an unpredictable fashion due to its football-like shape and launches opponents upward. The egg also functions as an item; it is catchable and throwable despite its much shorter fuse compared to similar explosive-related attacks. All of these properties make Rear Egg an incredibly versatile projectile that can be used for ledge trapping, comboing, camping, and neutral in general. Overall, their four specials have impressive utility with both physical and projectile options.

Banjo & Kazooie have an unremarkable grab game, with below-average reach. While each of their throws have vastly different functions, only in very specific situations are they useful outside of getting the opponent away from them (with the exception of their back throw). Forward throw is only really useful for putting opponents off-stage, with its awkward angle and high base knockback making it useless for combos while its nearly nonexistent knockback growth prevents it KOing. Up throw is useful for setting up juggles with up air, but has too much end lag to actually have any true follow-ups. Down throw buries the opponent, leading into various guaranteed follow-ups at very high percentages, although it is generally inferior to King K. Rool's similar down throw due to less bury time. The only one of the duo's throws that has consistently good usage is their back throw, a spinning throw almost identical to Mario's but more powerful, and is an extraordinary KO option at the ledge at high percentages, while its damage and trajectory allow for powerful follow-ups or edgeguarding in other situations. As a whole, for Banjo & Kazooie, grabbing is a high-risk, low-reward undertaking that usually only sets stocks when their opponent is at a very high percentage; at other times, the best that their throws can do is to rack up damage and put distance between them, only subtracting from their options for getting out of the disadvantage.

Alongside their grab and throws, the pair have other considerable weaknesses to balance their strengths. Outside of their smash attacks, Wonderwing, and offstage aerials, Banjo & Kazooie's potential to KO is somewhat limited despite their status as a heavyweight fighter. Most of their moves are unremarkable among their weight class in terms of power, and unlike other fighters with poor KOing abilities, Banjo & Kazooie have a very limited combo game. The duo's range is also unremarkable, despite Kazooie's lack of an hurtbox, which means that they will generally have issues trading blows with conventional swordfighters. Similar to Wario, Banjo & Kazooie have a wide hurtbox, and they are susceptible to combos and juggles due to their heavy weight, fast falling speed, slow air speed, low jump height, and lack of fast escape options. Their overall mobility is unorthodox; their excellent run speed is offset by their poor initial dash speed, which is tied for the fifth-worst, their high vertical recovery options are hampered by their low jumps, poor air speed, and fast falling speed, and their grounded mobility is hindered by the lowest traction in the game alongside Mii Gunner. Additionally, the duo's special moves, while strong, have significant flaws. Egg Firing has a slow firing rate on its own, and weak power when the pair transitions to Breegull Blaster; also, Breegull Blaster's eggs become weaker with repeated use, discouraging excessive use of the move. If the pair runs out of golden feathers, they lose access to Wonderwing, eliminating a potent move with plenty of offensive and defensive utility; Wonderwing is also vulnerable to grabs despite its invincibility, although due to its speed, an opponent taking advantage of this is relatively rare, and is notoriously unsafe on shield and on whiff, further punishing heavily its misuse. Rear Egg, while being a relatively potent combo tool, can be turned against the duo as opponents can grab it and use it due to its status as an item, as well as the fact that that a previously-laid grenade egg must explode or reach the blast zone before a new one can be laid, meaning the player must wait a while to try again if an egg misses an opponent. Shock Spring Jump requires slight charge time to make their recovery reliable, and it also does not have a hitbox outside of the Shock Spring Pad itself, making it vulnerable to aggressive edgeguarding.

Overall, Banjo & Kazooie are a fairly unorthodox character, but can be considered to fall in the heavyweight trapper archetype, similar to Link, R.O.B. and Snake, being centered on maintaining stage control with the help of a powerful explosive item, while at the same time being capable of fighting melee and having access to a strong finisher in Wonderwing. They are a quite versatile fighter that can adapt to multiple playstyles even over the course of a single match, though they are more adept to turtling playstyles. However, their capabilities fall somewhat short next to comparable characters; Grenade Eggs are not as good as they could seem at controlling space due to their limited lifetime, and the duo's overall frame data and KO power is unimpressive for this archetype, limiting their potential to act aggressively.</p>
