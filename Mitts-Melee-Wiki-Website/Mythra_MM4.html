<h1>Mythra</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Mythra is the faster Blade of the Aegis duo, possessing vastly superior mobility and overall frame data to her counterpart (mainly in regards to overall duration in terms of ending lag), but weaker attacks and overall shorter range. Like Pyra, she is a middleweight, albeit on the lighter end of the weight class, due to weighing the same as the Ice Climbers, Lucario, Wolf, Villager and Steve. Mythra boasts the 11th fastest air speed, 8th fastest walking speed, 7th fastest falling speed, 7th highest gravity value, 5th fastest dashing speed, and the fastest initial dash in the game, as well as decent traction. However, Mythra's jump height is below-average, while her short hop, double jump and air acceleration values are merely average. Overall, these traits make her a character similar to the likes of Captain Falcon, Sheik, Chrom or Little Mac; she is a very fast and generally offense-oriented character who excels at whiff punishing, tech-chasing, comboing, juggling and maintaining stage control in the neutral game, and has access to useful burst options as well.

One of Mythra's greatest strengths is the speed and utility of her grounded moveset. Neutral attack is Mythra's fastest move, coming on frame 2; this makes it useful for intercepting opposing attacks or sometimes even approaching, the latter thanks to her incredibly fast ground speed. As a swordswoman who fights with her respective Aegis Sword, almost all of Mythra's standard attacks (barring the first hit of neutral attack) are also disjointed as well, aiding her in directly challenging incoming attacks.

All three of Mythra's tilt attacks are fairly quick moves, with all of them possessing the ability to start combos. Down tilt has fast startup and very low ending lag, as well as fairly low knockback even at very high percents, allowing it to combo into most of her standard moveset; up tilt can combo into itself and/or most of her aerials; and even forward tilt can combo at low to mid percents. The speed of Mythra's tilts can make them difficult to react to, and good spacing can sometimes potentially also make them difficult to punish as well. Her dash attack is fast by swordfighter standards, coming out on frame 9, and it also provides her with solid forward momentum that makes it fairly useful as a burst option. Finally, her smash attacks are decently fast KOing options with solid ranges: forward smash comes out on frame 14 and is her strongest smash attack with the most range, but has the slowest startup of her smashes; up smash comes out on frame 9 and has a lingering hitbox, making it a decent out of shield option from the front; and down smash is her fastest smash attack, coming out on frame 8, and hits twice simultaneously on both sides. However, Mythra's smash attacks are fairly weak; they only KO at moderately high percents, even when fully charged.

Mythra's aerial attacks are also fairly decent as well. Her up, back and down aerials can all autocancel in a short hop, and except for down aerial, all of her aerials come out on frame 10 or sooner. Neutral aerial hits three times and provides good coverage all around her; similarly to Byleth's, it also possesses a landing hitbox, which can be used to start combos. Her forward and back aerials are good combo finishers (with back aerial more importantly also being useful for starting or extending combos), covering a decent area in front and/or behind her. Up aerial is a good juggle move, and has an extremely generous autocancel window, even more so than all her other aerials. Finally, down aerial completely lacks the meteor smashing capability of Pyra's equivalent move, but it is Mythra's most damaging aerial attack if hit with the clean hit of the move, and possesses the most KO power of her aerials as well.

Mythra's special moves are also fairly versatile as well. Lightning Buster is a chargeable move that comes out on frame 9 when uncharged; charging it increases the move's power, and the move even possesses a hitbox on Mythra's sword while charging (nicknamed the "bustersaw" hitbox); it can KO most opponents near the edge at around 100% with a mild charge, and it can even be used off-stage as a mixup to cover airdodges. Lightning Buster can even be reversed after charging, similarly to Mii Swordfighter's Blurring Blade and Sephiroth's Shadow Flare, which can potentially be used for mindgames. Photon Edge is a useful burst option which can hit up to six times and and has decent damage output as well; it can be difficult to challenge thanks to the move's hitboxes being placed on the multiple visible Mythra duplicates, none of which have a hurtbox, and it can also be used as a horizontal recovery option as well. Ray of Punishment starts on frame 10, making it a decent out of shield option when combined with the initial slash's hitbox, and the initial slash in particular combos into the resulting projectile; holding the special button or pressing it more than once turns the move into Chroma Dust instead, with the singular downward projectile instead replaced with multiple smaller projectiles. Ray of Punishment in particular is also an excellent combo finisher as well. As a recovery move, Ray of Punishment/Chroma Dust is capable of sweetspotting ledges while rising, and if Mythra goes past a ledge, the projectile(s) can somewhat cover her ledge grab. Lastly, her down special, Swap, swaps her out with Pyra while granting some intangibility during the switch, allowing the player to switch playstyles on the fly.

Mythra's grab game is not nearly as overwhelming as the rest of her moveset, but it is not without its uses. Her standing grab has average range, but it is slightly disjointed and is tied for the fastest in the game startup-wise. Her dash and pivot grabs also have similarly slightly disjointed grabboxes as well, with the former in particular additionally having decent forward momentum. Her pummel has average speed but an above-average damage output, making it a decent one overall. Down throw is her most damaging throw, and it is also her main combo throw, leading into aerials at low to medium percentages. Forward throw can confirm into dash attack at low percentages, and can also set up tech-chases and edgeguards. Back throw can be used for positioning or setting up edgeguards, but is less useful than down and forward throws. Finally, her up throw is her least useful throw, although it is difficult to react to and can potentially set up juggles.

In addition to her moveset, Mythra also possesses a special mechanic called Foresight, which functions similarly to Bayonetta's Bat Within. If Mythra dodges a few frames before she would have been hit by a move, Mythra takes roughly 50% of that move's damage and no knockback, while the opponent suffers additional lag and is put in a slowdown state similarly to Witch Time, allowing Mythra a free combo, neutral win or even a KO. This helps her disadvantaged state, as Foresight allows her to escape slightly untrue combos or juggles.

Despite her immense agility, Mythra is balanced by a severe lack of KO options (although swapping to Pyra remedies this completely). Outside of her smash attacks and charged Lightning Buster, none of her moveset reliably KOs at the ledge at 150%; however, Mythra still has the ability to combo several of her weaker attacks into those moves (such as comboing down tilt into Lightning Buster via the "bustersaw" charging hitbox) for potential KO confirms, which may alleviate this weakness. Additionally, Mythra's raw damage output is also very poor, a weakness shared with Sheik. This also ties into yet another weakness that Mythra has; outside of her aerials, forward and down tilts, and sufficiently charged Lightning Buster, none of Mythra's moves are safer than -11 on shield, which can make her vulnerable to shield grabs and aggressive out of shield options if her attacks are not properly spaced. Also, her range is only average for a swordfighter, and she lacks a projectile outside of her up special, meaning she can sometimes struggle against certain zoners, although her excellent mobility compensates for that. Mythra's grab game is also not without its flaws, either; starting at higher percents, her throw combos stop being true, limiting the utility of her forward and down throws (especially the latter). None of her throws reliably KO either, even at Sudden Death percentages. Her only utility from her throws at these percentages is positional throws.

Her aerials also have weaknesses as well. Despite being decently fast for a swordfighter overall, her aerial frame data is only average for a fighter, with her quickest aerials, neutral and forward aerial, coming out on frame 8, making them unsuitable for breaking out of combos. Compared to most other fighters who share a similar archetype, none of her aerials possess decent KO power, with similar fighters having at least one with notable KO potential. Examples include Mythra's back aerial, Greninja's forward aerial, and Sheik's up aerial. Her back aerial, coming out on frame 10, has below-average startup for a combo tool. Her down aerial is also unarguably her worst aerial. Due to coming out on frame 13, down aerial is among the slowest non-stall-then-fall down aerials in the game without a meteor effect, and it launches opponents too far to have any meaningful utility after landing, all while still having very poor KO potential.

Her special moves, while decent, have weaknesses to balance them out. While Lightning Buster is a potential KO option, it only covers one side of Mythra (except for the first hit, which hits both behind and in front of her), leaving her open if misused. Photon Edge is very unsafe on shield and renders Mythra helpless if used in the air. It also does not sweetspot the ledge until after the move ends. Additionally, Photon Edge has transcendent priority, meaning that it is easily intercepted by most projectiles; and while the hitboxes have impressive horizontal disjoint, they are not very vertically disjointed from Mythra's main hurtbox, which is static and does not match up with the Mythra duplicates visible during the move, meaning that if she recovers using the move, she is highly vulnerable to meteor smashes from directly above (especially if she recovers low with the move). Ray of Punishment also covers decent vertical distance but no horizontal distance by itself, although Mythra does have decent horizontal drift afterwards.

Foresight is also a double-edged sword for Mythra. While it allows Mythra to punish blockable attacks, it also gives Mythra the slowest dodges in the game, with intangibility for her forward ro, spot dodge, and back roll starting on frame 7 for the former two dodges and 8 for the latter, making her vulnerable to grabs and other unblockable attacks. Mythra's directional air dodge distance is counterbalanced by the Foresight mechanic itself. If Foresight is activated during her air dodges, she will travel downward instead of remaining in place, which may lead to self-destructs. Additionally, if it is activated during her directional air dodge, she will travel a shorter distance than usual and will still suffer the entire ending lag of the dodge. Unlike with regular directional air dodges, Mythra in this particular state is not even able to grab ledges, due to the ending lag being considered part of the Foresight animation, along with said animation being impossible to interupt in any way until it is completed.

Perhaps Mythra's single biggest weakness, however, is her very exploitable recovery despite traveling an acceptable distance overall if not interupted, a weakness shared with Pyra, although the former's recovery is noticeably better than latter's. Although she has very good air speed and her directional air dodge covers more distance than most others in the game (barring those of Ness and Lucas), her double jump height is merely average at best, her falling speed is incredibly fast, and as mentioned before, Ray of Punishment has no horizontal travel distance by itself, while Photon Edge leaves Mythra helpless and does not snap to ledges until the very end in addition to not protecting her from above. Additionally, her directional air dodge is risky to use for recovery due to the Foresight mechanic as mentioned above. If Mythra uses Ray of Punishment on an off-stage opponent while she is recovering, they can wall jump tech after getting hit by the projectile and punish her, similarly to the Tech Check technique. Mythra is also susceptible to semi-spikes, as getting hit by a sufficiently strong one means that she will be too low to use Photon Edge, and likely will not be able to cover the required horizontal distance with Ray of Punishment either. It is also very common for even the weakest of projectiles, such as Mario's Fireball to be enough to gimp Mythra and prevent her from recovering to the stage.

Disadvantage can also be difficult for Mythra, though doable with Foresight. Her fast falling speed and high gravity render her susceptible to certain combos (such as Steve's jab/forward tilt combos), and her average-at-best air acceleration can make it difficult for her to adjust her aerial drift while being juggled compared to other speedy characters with superior air acceleration, such as Fox, Sheik and Zero Suit Samus. And unlike Pokémon Change, Swap does not grant intangibility until frame 6, making it inefficient as a combo breaker. This is further compounded by Pyra's disadvantage state being even worse than Mythra's.

Overall, Mythra is an incredibly quick swordswoman who excels at zone-breaking, pressuring, tech-chasing, and stage control. She also has respectable combo potential, and is decent at juggling and, like Pyra, punishing (albeit not to the same impact as her counterpart). In addition, Mythra is best utilized when she and Pyra have the advantage so as to alleviate their respective weaknesses and amplify their respective strengths, and when horizontal recovery distance is required, whereas it is considered best to switch to her counterpart to keep advantage due to Pyra's vastly stronger attacks and more impactful punishes.

Mythra's strengths generally outweigh her weaknesses, and players like Sparg0, Cloudy and Cosmos have demonstrated in offline competitive play that she is indeed a competitively viable character, especially when used in tandem with Pyra via Swap. Although Pyra and Mythra's shared viability when used together remains unclear in the long term, most players believe they are top tier or even among the best characters in the game, alongside the commonly accepted Pikachu and Joker.</p>
