<h1>Pikachu</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Pikachu is a small lightweight, tied with Kirby, Olimar, Sephiroth and Mewtwo for the seventh lightest fighter. It has overall good mobility, possessing fast walking and dashing speeds, high jumps, is tied for the ninth-highest air acceleration and has the fourth-highest traction, but slightly above average falling speed and gravity and below-average air speed. Due to its fast mobility, a good projectile in Thunder Jolt, good frame data and some of the fastest defensive options, Pikachu has a good approach and great neutral game.

Pikachu has a decent grab and throw game despite its poor grab range. It has a fast pummel and its forward and back throws are good for setting up edgeguards. Its up throws can combo into Thunder and is able to KO at around 170% on average. Down throw is a fantastic combo starter, setting up "nair loops" which involves using dragdown nair and up tilt to rack up damage while reacting to the DI of the opponent to continue the combo. It can also lead into various combos and kill confirms depending on the opponent's DI, including up air bridges which can take the opponent all the way offstage and kill with a forward air. Extending Pikachu's combo game revolves using its aerial attacks to drag the opponent down, extending the combo further. Thunder Jolt also compliments its advantage state nicely as it can combo or be used to pressure the opponent and make them hesitatingly pick options while under pressure.

Pikachu's recovery is also great, with Quick Attack being used to travel a long distance from many places offstage and mix up how it recovers with its two jolts (note these must be executed to create a 30 degree angle, or the second jolt will not come out). Skull Bash can be used to recover from very far distances, although it leaves it vulnerable if the opponent can reach it, and Pikachu can reverse edgeguard opponents with aerials and thunder and still make it back to stage. This all makes Pikachu's recovery one of the best in the game and allows it to go very deep offstage to secure stocks with edgeguards.

Pikachu's main strengths are its fast frame data and dominant edgeguarding game, with the latter being considered among the best of the cast. All of Pikachu's aerials can autocancel in a short hop and its neutral, forward, back and up aerials are fast, all of them except for up aerial are multihits that can combo into each other, with their extremely low ending lag making them excellent for combos, edgeguarding, and potential zero-to-deaths. Down aerial can meteor smash or spike in its first two active frames and is fast for its category, while up aerial is good for juggling. Pikachu's down aerial also is its only aerial with over 20 frames of ending lag.

Pikachu is not without weaknesses, however. It has poor range outside of forward smash and down tilt, with most of its attacks being barely disjointed or not at all. Because of its lack of range, Pikachu tends to rely on using Thunder Jolt to help it approach the opponent. It tends to get KO'd at earlier percents due to being light, and it also bears inconsistent raw KO power itself. Forward and up smash are burdened by several sourspots, with the former being stronger in the mid hit, while its forward tilt, forward and back aerials and its up and back throws are unfit for KOing until around 150% or above, and while Thunder is powerful, it has slow start-up and has high ending lag. A very notable weakness in Pikachu's neutral is its inability to trade due to many of its aerials being multihits, and so in a trade Pikachu will deal about 1% while taking the full damage of the move it traded with, which is a big deal with how light the character is.

Overall, Pikachu's strengths outweigh its weaknesses and it is regularly considered a top-tier or even a contender for the best character in the game.</p>
