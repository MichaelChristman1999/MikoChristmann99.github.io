<h1>Palutena</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Palutena is a tall middleweight. Her walking speed, dash speed, air acceleration and gravity are above average (with her air acceleration being the fifth best in the game), her traction and falling speed are both average, and her air speed is below average. In addition, she has relatively high jumps, giving her overall excellent mobility, albeit being a bit slower in the air.

Palutena has a dynamic, well-rounded moveset. She has both excellent combo potential and good zoning tools, meaning she can be played effectively either defensively or offensively. Her staff counts as a disjointed hitbox and she has two projectiles in her moveset as part of her special moves, meaning she can apply safe pressure from a distance and force approaching opponents off her. Her projectiles are unique by the fact that they are completely unconventional. Her aerial-based moveset, speed and versatility means she can easily overwhelm opponents and quickly rack up damage.

Her ground attacks are generally the weakest part of her moveset, but they can be useful. Her jab has good range, can be held to deal more damage and can also be jab cancelled into other moves. Her dash attack is very fast and grants Palutena partial invincibility; it is also a KO option around 160%. Her tilt attacks are somewhat situational: forward tilt has a long-lasting hitbox and can be used to intercept approaching opponents and floor recoveries. Her down tilt has utility for edgeguarding opponents, while her up tilt - her tilt attack with the fastest startup - can be used for forcing opponents into the air and is even a viable KO option at higher percents.

Outside of her grounded attack moves, Palutena’s ground game is strong thanks to her grabs and throws having good utility, with her grabs being quick and having good range. Her down throw is her strongest combo throw, comboing into all of her aerials and having KO confirms at higher percents. Her back throw is her strongest throw, being capable of killing from the ledge around 130%, while her forward throw also has a kill confirm at higher percents with Explosive Flame. Her up throw is the weakest of her throws, though it still has utility for forcing opponents into the air where Palutena’s can safely apply aerial pressure.

Palutena's smash attacks are very viable KO options due to each having excellent range and dealing decent damage. Up smash has a very long-lasting hitbox and covers a lot of vertical range directly in front of Palutena; it can be used to KO opponents in the air and even intercept air dodges due to how long the hitbox lasts. Her forward and down smashes are similar, both in their damage output and the fact that they have a wind effect to move opponents away from Palutena if they are just outside of the move’s hitbox.

The strongest part of Palutena's moveset, however, is her aerials, each having strong combo or KO potential. Despite all of her aerials having rather high ending lag, this is compensated by their very low landing lag and generous autocancel windows making them very safe on shield. Her neutral aerial is a very fast and safe move, being Palutena’s best combo tool by far as it combos into her other aerial attacks (including itself) until reasonably high percents, while also having KO potential at very high percents. Her up aerial is an extremely good juggling tool capable of killing off the top blast zone around 100% (even on heavyweights), with its fairly large, long-lasting hitbox making it difficult to avoid. Her back aerial, like her dash attack, grants invincibility on Palutena's shield. It has the strongest knockback of any of her aerials and is one of Palutena’s best KO options, especially from down throw. Her forward aerial, while not quite as strong, is a good combo finisher with KO potential towards the side blast zones at very high percents. While her down aerial is generally considered the weakest of her aerials, if used offstage it can have a meteor smash effect, meaning it can kill opponents at the bottom blast zone.

Additionally, Palutena’s special moves each have utility, most prominently for zoning. Her Explosive Flame can be used on opponents some distance from Palutena, and is good for forcing them into the air or for securing KOs from the top blast zone at higher percents. Her neutral special attack, Autoreticle, while not quite as useful as Explosive Flame, is another projectile which can apply safe pressure and rack up damage from a distance. Her up special, Warp, is a teleport which grants invincibility on frames 16-32. In addition to being useful for getting into a more favourable stage position, its invincibility makes it an extremely useful recovery tool which, combined with Palutena’s high jumps, gives her a very good recovery. Finally, her down special is a counter which acts similarly to Lucina and Marth’s counter when used on nearby opponents, but can also reflect projectiles from a distance. Lastly, several of her moves, such as her tilts and aerial moves, have additional shield damage, making her good at pressuring, especially since her forward and back aerials can autocancel in a short hop fast fall.

Although Palutena has very good strengths, she does have a number of noticeable weaknesses. Her most glaring problem is her mediocre ground game, with all of her grounded attacks bar her dash attack coming out on frame 8 or later and almost all of her moves either have high startup (smash attacks and down tilt), punishable ending lag (forward, back and down aerials and smash attacks) long duration (all of her tilts) or all three (forward tilt and special moves), making her very vulnerable if her attacks miss or are dodged or shielded. While some of her grounded attacks have the potential to KO, such as forward tilt, up tilt and dash attack, it is not until much higher percents than her other attacks. This is another weakness of Palutena - while a number of her moves have the potential to KO at reasonable percents, she can still struggle to secure kills due to her options being either somewhat risky or situational. Though her back aerial is a reliable kill option at reasonable percents, it has high ending lag and her smash attacks each have a noticeable amount of startup and very high ending lag, making them punishable, while Explosive Flame is also easily punishable if whiffed due to its endlag and her up aerial relies on Palutena being underneath her opponent. Furthermore, while Palutena’s recovery is decent in its distance, Warp leaves her helpless and lacks a hitbox to protect her, which - combined with the fact that Palutena is a tall character - means that her recovery can be easily exploited by opponents who know how to intercept teleport recoveries.

Despite this, Palutena is generally considered at worst a high tier character due to her versatility, well-roundedness and relatively easy combo game. Her lack of overwhelming weaknesses means that there are few opponents she struggles against, and thus her representation at tournaments has generally been excellent thanks to players like Nairo maining her and achieving noteworthy results.</p>
