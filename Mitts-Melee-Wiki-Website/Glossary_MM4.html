<p>These terms apply to fighting games in general:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/Approach" title="Approach">Approaching</a></b>: Moving towards an opponent, usually in conjunction with attacks.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Attack" title="Attack">Attack</a></b>: Use of a move that damages the opponent.</li>
<li><b>Archetype</b>: Category that a fighter falls into based on their most commonly used moves and gameplans. There are numerous archetypes.</li>
<li><b><a href="/AI" class="mw-redirect" title="AI">AI</a></b> or <b>artificial intelligence</b>: Programmed behavior of computer-controlled characters. "Bad" AI means the intended function was done poorly.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Buff" title="Buff">Buff</a></b>:
<ol><li>Developmental improvement to a character in later game releases or balance patches.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Nerf" title="Nerf">Nerf</a></b>: Developmental weakening to a character in later game releases or in balance patches.</li></ul></li>
<li>Positive and temporary status effect.
<ul><li><b>Debuff</b>: Negative status effect.</li></ul></li></ol></li>
<li><b><a href="/Camp" class="mw-redirect" title="Camp">Camping</a></b>: Defensively staying away from the opponent, generally in one place, and prolonging the battle. When involved with exploits or other extreme tactics, camping can turn into <a href="#Stalling">stalling</a>.</li>
<li><b>Clean hit</b>: A well-timed hit that uses an attack's initial hitbox; usually much stronger than the late hit. Many attacks don't differentiate, but examples of those that do include <a href="/Fox_(SSBM)" title="Fox (SSBM)">Fox</a>'s <a href="/Up_smash" title="Up smash">up smash</a> in <i>Melee</i> and most <a href="/Sex_kick" title="Sex kick">sex kicks</a>.
<ul><li><b>Late hit</b>: A hit that uses an attack's later hitbox; usually weaker than the clean hit. Some attacks have a <a href="/Sourspot" class="mw-redirect" title="Sourspot">sourspot</a> that coincides with the late hit, like the <a href="/Knee_Smash" title="Knee Smash">Knee Smash</a></li>
<li>Some attacks have a <b>middle hit</b>, and some have even more stages (e.g. "clean-mid" or "late-mid").</li></ul>
<dl><dd><i>See also: <b><a href="#Sweetspot">sweetspot</a></b> and <b><a href="#Sweetspot">sourspot</a></b></i></dd></dl></li>
<li><b><a href="/Computer_player" class="mw-redirect" title="Computer player">Computer player</a></b>: A player that's entirely controlled by the game rather than by a human. In most of <i>Smash's</i> singleplayer modes, the human plays entirely against computer players. In multiplayer, they're usually only introduced by choice. Their difficulty is usually adjustable.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Clone" title="Clone">Clone</a></b>: A character that shares most of their moveset and animations with another character, rather than having a moveset unique to them.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Semi-clone" class="mw-redirect" title="Semi-clone">Semi-clone</a></b>: The "inbetween point" of being a non-cloned character and a clone, this is a character that shares some of their moveset and attributes with another character, but also has a significant amount of different animations, attributes and moves, to the point where calling them a clone is not entirely accurate.</li>
<li><b>Pseudo-clone</b>: A character that has some shared attacks, animations and attributes with another character, similarly to a semi-clone. However, whereas semi-clones are still overall based on other characters, pseudo-clones are largely unique overall, and calling them semi-clones would be somewhat misleading.</li>
<li><b>Decloning</b>: The act of making a cloned character more unique in the transition from one game to another through giving them new moves, animations and altered attributes, sometimes in conjunction with the original character getting a few changes of their own as well. Also known as "Luigification" in the <i>Smash Bros.</i> community, referring to <a href="/Luigi" title="Luigi">Luigi</a>, who initially started off as a clone of Mario in <i>Smash 64</i>, but has been extensively decloned from the latter over time in later installments.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="/Combo" title="Combo">Combo</a></b>: A series of attacks strung together in succession.
<ul><li>True combo: A series of attacks strung together where the opponent was truly incapable of escaping before the finish.</li>
<li>String: A series of attacks strung together where the opponent was capable of reacting inbetween blows and could have thus escaped.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Counter</b>: Can refer to either:
<ol><li>A special move that relies on waiting to be struck first, and then retaliating, as originally seen with Marth and Roy's <a href="/Counter" title="Counter">Counter</a> in <i>Melee</i>.</li>
<li>A character who has an advantage over another; for example, in <i>Brawl</i>, <a href="/Pikachu_(SSBB)" title="Pikachu (SSBB)">Pikachu</a> counters <a href="/Falco_(SSBB)" title="Falco (SSBB)">Falco</a>, as documented on the <a href="/Character_matchup_(SSBB)" title="Character matchup (SSBB)">matchup chart</a>. These can be further divided into <b>soft counters</b> and <b>hard counters</b>; the former refers to matchups where one character has a slight advantage and the latter refers to matchups where one character has a significant advantage.</li></ol></li>
<li><b><a href="/Dash" title="Dash">Dashing</a></b>: A form of movement, that involves the character running across the ground. This is usually the fastest means of movement for a character, though a few characters can move faster through other means.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Dodge" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Dodge">Dodge</a></b>: A move that makes a character temporarily intangible to attacks. Can also refer to general movement utilized to avoid getting hit.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Rolling_dodge" class="mw-redirect" title="Rolling dodge">Rolling dodge</a></b>: A dodging maneuver that involves moving sideways via a roll or similar movement.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Sidestep" class="mw-redirect" title="Sidestep">Sidestep</a></b>: A dodging maneuver that involves doing a quick dodge in place, typically with less vulnerability after completion but leaves the player intangible for a more limited time frame. Also referred to as a "spot dodge".</li>
<li><b><a href="/Air_dodge" title="Air dodge">Air dodge</a></b>: A dodging maneuver that involves an aerial character doing a dodging maneuver while moving through the air. Behaves differently in <i>Melee</i>, in <i>Brawl</i>, in <i>SSB4</i> and in <i>Ultimate</i>. In <i>Melee</i>, characters can air dodge once toward a small distance in any direction while leaving the character helpless afterward, and all existing aerial momentum will be halted/replaced; in <i>Brawl</i>, characters cannot air dodge toward any direction, but will not be left helpless after air dodging, can air dodge as many times as desired, will not endure any landing lag, and their aerial momentum is fully preserved; in <i>SSB4</i>, air dodges function similarly to in <i>Brawl</i>, but characters endure landing lag; and in <i>Ultimate</i>, characters can only air dodge once in the air and can air dodge in any direction, but their aerial momentum is fully preserved/merely shifted rather than being interrupted altogether.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Exploit</b>: A case where separate mechanics or interactions work as intended, but cause unintended outcomes when combined. An example is how <i>Melee</i> recognizes that the <a href="/Ice_Climbers" title="Ice Climbers">Ice Climbers</a>, Popo and Nana, are the "same" character when attacking, and also recognizes that characters being hit by attacks from the character cannot break out of grabs; when these two mechanics are combined, however, <a href="/Wobbling" title="Wobbling">wobbling</a> occurs, as grabbed opponents cannot break out of Popo's grab because they are constantly being hit by "one" character.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Frame" title="Frame">Frame</a></b>: The primary unit of time at which game runs. The <i>Smash Bros.</i> series runs at 60 frames per second, meaing 1 frame = 1/60 of a second.</li>
<li><b>Frame data</b>: Buzzword used to refer to the technical properties of a move overall; often extended to refer to a character's moveset as a whole.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Free-for-all" class="mw-redirect" title="Free-for-all">Free-for-all</a></b>: A match with more than two players that does not involve two teams. A free-for-all match would also theoretically be played with multiple teams.</li>
<li><b>Footsies</b>: The term itself means different things to different people, but the most common definition is gameplay that takes place directly in front of the fighters. Thoughtful strategy and mindgames are key at this distance, as using random moves is highly inadvisable.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Grab" title="Grab">Grabbing</a></b>: Clutching the foe so they cannot move for a brief period of time. Usually, a throw follows.
<ul><li><b>Dash grab</b>: A type of a grab that a character performs out of a dash. Usually slower than a standing grab and more punishable if missed, but the momentum of a character's dash can allow them to grab from farther away.</li>
<li><b>Pivot grab</b>: A type of grab introduced in <i>Brawl</i>, where a dashing character turns around to grab. Pivot grans are usually slightly slower than standing or dash grabs, but generally have less ending lag and farther reach than dash grabs.</li>
<li><b>Boost grab</b>: A type of grab introduced in <i>Melee</i>, where the momentum from a dash attack is transfered into a dash grab, increasing its range for some characters. It is performed by inputting a dash attack, and then inputting a grab quickly after, which cancels the dash attack into a grab.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Command_grab" class="mw-redirect" title="Command grab">Command grab</a></b>: A special move that acts like a grab, bypassing shields and putting the opponent in a special grabbed state. Examples include <a href="/Falcon_Dive" title="Falcon Dive">Falcon Dive</a> and <a href="/Flying_Slam" title="Flying Slam">Flying Slam</a>.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Hit_grab" class="mw-redirect" title="Hit grab">Hit grab</a></b>: A special type of grab that is blockable, despite putting opponents in a grabbed state when connecting. Examples include <a href="/Fishing_Rod" title="Fishing Rod">Fishing Rod</a> and <a href="/Buster_Wolf" title="Buster Wolf">Buster Wolf</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="/Glitch" title="Glitch">Glitch</a></b>: A flaw or oversight in the game's programming which results in an unintended outcome. An example would be the <a href="/Name_Entry_glitch" title="Name Entry glitch">Name Entry glitch</a> in <i>Melee</i>, where the developers did not foresee a case where players would attempt to enter a name and leave the character select screen at the same time.</li>
<li><b>Hit and Run</b>: An archetype which encompasses fighters that excel at running in, getting some damage, then running away. Being unpredictable and evasive is key to characters in this archetype, as they usually are very easy to kill if they are caught. Time out victories are most commonly found with this category.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Hitbox" title="Hitbox">Hitbox</a></b>: The area of effect for an attack. Generally in proportion of the action; a kick attack should generally have hitboxes on the foot and leg.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Hurtbox" class="mw-redirect" title="Hurtbox">Hurtbox</a></b>: The area on a character or object, where an opposing hitbox must touch to register hitting the character/object.</li>
<li><b>Disjointed hitbox</b>: A hitbox that extends away from the character's hurtbox, thus allowing it to pass through opposing hitboxes without hurting the user. Characters with weapons, such as swordfighters like <a href="/Marth" title="Marth">Marth</a>, generally tend to have many attacks with disjointed hitboxes.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="/Hitstun" title="Hitstun">Hitstun</a></b>: The time when one cannot take any action after being hit.
<ul><li><b>Hitstun canceling</b>: The act of canceling an attack's hitstun before its duration finishes. A mechanic unique to <i>Brawl</i>, where characters can air dodge or perform an aerial attack out of hitstun after a certain amount of frames regardless of the hitstun amount.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="/Item" title="Item">Item</a></b>: An object spawned in the middle of a battle. Items have a variety of uses, including healing one's self or ally, or damaging a target. Items, unless they can be spawned by a character's move, are not permitted in competitive play.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Juggle" class="mw-redirect" title="Juggle">Juggle</a></b>: Any series of attacks which keep an enemy in the air, preventing them from landing.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Lag" title="Lag">Lag</a></b>: A catch-all term for delay in an action. There are several different types of lag.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Start-up_lag" class="mw-redirect" title="Start-up lag">Start-up lag</a></b>: Refers to the period of time between an action being inputted and the action having an effect.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Ending_lag" class="mw-redirect" title="Ending lag">Ending lag</a></b>: Refers to the period of time between an action's effect finishing and the player being able to input another action.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Landing_lag" class="mw-redirect" title="Landing lag">Landing lag</a></b>: A different type of ending lag that occurs when a character lands with an aerial attack before the aerial's completion, which causes the character to go through a special landing animation where the player cannot input another action before the animation's completion.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Wi-Fi_lag" title="Wi-Fi lag">Wi-Fi lag</a></b>: Refers to the delay inherent in communicating between players that are competing over the internet, which can skew the outcome of tight situations if long and/or inconsistent.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Display_lag" title="Display lag">Display lag</a></b>: Refers to when a display device (e.g. TV) is behind the current game state, leading to players reacting to a situation that has already passed.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="/Leak" class="mw-redirect" title="Leak">Leak</a></b>: A revelation of information about an unreleased game or other unreleased content released prematurely, from an unofficial source and without the creators' consent. Leaks, whether real or fake, are often the subject of rumors.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Mindgame" title="Mindgame">Mindgame</a></b>: Strategies or techniques employed for the purpose of outwitting the opponent psychologically. The primary component of cerebral skill, the counterpart to technical skill.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Bait" class="mw-redirect" title="Bait">Baiting</a></b>: The act of trying to trick the opponent into doing an action that the player can then punish them for.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Pressuring" class="mw-redirect" title="Pressuring">Pressuring</a></b>: The act of limiting the opponent's options to force them to react in a detrimental manner.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Read" class="mw-redirect" title="Read">Read</a></b>: A term used to refer to when a player successfully predicts the opponent's next action and is able to preemptively react to punish it effectively.

They rely on getting in their opponent's face and applying pressure until they force the opponent to make an opening, then swarm the opponent to kill them quickly. However, if the opponent either keeps them at a distance or is simply patient, the rushdown fighter does not have much in terms of a backup plan and will likely lose.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Shield" title="Shield">Shield</a></b>: Blocking an attack.

<li><b><a href="/Technical_skill" title="Technical skill">Technical skill</a></b>: Known as "tech skill" for short, refers to a player's ability to manipulate their controller to produce desired inputs. Players with greater tech skill can make inputs faster and more precisely, allowing them to more often and effectively pull off maneuvers that require more complicated inputs.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Training_mode" class="mw-redirect" title="Training mode">Training mode</a></b>: Allows one to become familiar with the character that one is using in a controlled setting.</li>

<ul><li><b>Infinite</b>: A combo that can continue indefinitely regardless of damage while keeping the opponent locked in with no chance to escape if performed correctly. Functionally equivalent to a zero-death, but there is also the potential to stall time (which all tournaments have a rules against). An example of an infinite is <a href="/Wobbling" title="Wobbling">wobbling</a> in <i>Melee</i>.
<ul><li><b>Wall infinite</b>: An infinite combo performed against a wall. An example would be using Fox's <a href="/Reflector_(Fox)" title="Reflector (Fox)">Reflector</a> down special (also known as the shine) against a wall in <i>Melee</i>, or using King Dedede's down throw to chaingrab an opponent near a wall in <i>Brawl</i>.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Zoner</b>: An archetype that encompasses fighters who excel at keeping the opponent at a distance. This is done by long ranged moves or projectiles and a few very powerful short ranged attacks. The goal is to both kill the opponent without them getting close and wear down their patience into running into the short ranged attack. But just as easily as they can punish, they can also be punished, with the opponent tricking them into using the wrong move potentially leading to massive damage.</li></ul>

<li><b><a href="/Glide_toss" title="Glide toss">Glide toss</a></b>: A technique that involves immediately cancelling a character's roll by throwing an item, which results in the character sliding in the roll's direction while throwing the item. The distance slid depends on the character, what direction the character was rolling, and the specific time they interrupted the roll. The distance slid can vary from character to character, ranging from covering almost no distance to traveling almost the entire stage length. In <i>SSB4</i> and <i>Ultimate</i>, canceling a roll into an item throw completely halts the user's horizontal momentum, and in <i>Ultimate</i>, the window to perform the technique has been reduced to only two frames, so the technique sees most use in <i>Melee</i> and <i>Brawl</i>.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Helpless" title="Helpless">Helpless</a></b>/<b>Special fall</b>: A state where a character in the air is unable to perform any action until landing.

Often utilized during edge-guarding. It does not exist in <i>SSB4</i> and <i>Ultimate</i> due to their altered ledge mechanics, and only sees use in <i>Smash 64</i>, <i>Melee</i> and <i>Brawl</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Guest/third-party character</b>: A playable character that is not originally from a Nintendo property; <a href="/Sonic" class="mw-redirect" title="Sonic">Sonic</a>, <a href="/Snake" class="mw-redirect" title="Snake">Snake</a>, and <a href="/Mega_Man" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a> are all examples of guests.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Meteor_smash" title="Meteor smash">Meteor smash</a></b>: An attack that launches opponents downward. Since grounded opponents cannot be hit through the stage, such attacks will instead cause them to bounce off the stage, resulting in them flying upward with reduced knockback.

Most characters can only use one midair jump before landing or grabbing a ledge, but some characters can jump an additional multiple times in the air before landing.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Double_jump_cancel" title="Double jump cancel">Double jump cancel</a></b>: The act of canceling the momentum of a character's midair jump with an attack. Can only be performed by the few characters with a delayed midair jump, such as <a href="/Ness" title="Ness">Ness</a> or <a href="/Mewtwo" title="Mewtwo">Mewtwo</a>.

<li><b><a href="/Momentum_canceling" title="Momentum canceling">Momentum canceling</a></b>: A technique, where a player in knockback performs various actions, to redirect or negate their momentum, allowing them to survive blows that would have KOed them otherwise. Only possible in <i>Brawl</i>, as hitstun canceling is required for a character to be able to act while in knockback.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Moonwalk" title="Moonwalk">Moonwalking</a></b>: A technique that allows a character to move backward a small distance while dashing. It can only be performed in <i>Melee</i></li>

<li><b><a href="/Plank" class="mw-redirect" title="Plank">Planking</a></b>: A technique where a player stays hanging on the ledge beyond what is necessary, abusing the ledge's invincibility to remain safe. One of the most prominent stalling tactics. It is much less abusable in <i>SSB4</i> and <i>Ultimate</i> than in prior games due to altered ledge mechanics.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Priority" title="Priority">Priority</a></b>: The mechanic that determines what happens when the hitboxes of two attacks collide with each other. Usually results in the two attacks being interrupted and thus "cancelled out", though if one colliding hitbox deals significantly more damage than the other, only the weaker attack will be interrupted while the stronger attack continues throughout its normal duration. Also erroneously used to refer to an attack's general ability (through its speed, reach, hitbox duration, and hitbox placement) to bypass other attacks.
<ul><li><b><a href="/Transcendent_priority" class="mw-redirect" title="Transcendent priority">Transcendent priority</a></b>: A term used to refer to a property some hitboxes have, where they are completely unable to clang with the hitboxes of all other attacks, allowing them to bypass priority altogether.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li><b><a href="/Forward_smash" title="Forward smash">Forward smash</a></b>: Also known as "side smash, and referred to as "f-smash" for short, inputted by pressing the attack button in conjunction with a tapped left or right directional input. Typically involves the character throwing a mighty blow in front of them, with generally more reach than their other attacks.

Some characters also have up smashes that are weaker than their other smashes while being multi-hitting.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Down_smash" title="Down smash">Down smash</a></b>: Referred to as "d-smash" for short, inputted by pressing the attack button in conjunction with a tapped down directional input. Typically involves the character striking both the front and back of them, whether at the same time or in succession.

<li><b><a href="/Space_animal" title="Space animal">Space animal</a></b>: Refers to <a href="/Fox" class="mw-redirect" title="Fox">Fox</a>, <a href="/Falco" class="mw-redirect" title="Falco">Falco</a> and <a href="/Wolf" class="mw-redirect" title="Wolf">Wolf</a>, whose combination of fast falling speed and high gravity causes them to be fairly vulnerable to certain combos and chain throws that are less effective against many other characters, especially in <i>Melee</i> and <i>Brawl</i>. <a href="/Captain_Falcon" title="Captain Falcon">Captain Falcon</a> is also sometimes lumped into this group, especially in <i>Melee</i>, due to also having a similarly fast falling speed and high gravity that allows him to also get hit by "space animal combos".</li>
<li><b><a href="/Special_move" title="Special move">Special move</a></b>: A move that has unique or otherwise unusual properties, that go beyond merely damaging a foe, and can be typically initiated from the ground or air.

<li><b><a href="/Up_tilt" title="Up tilt">Up tilt</a></b>: Referred to as "u-tilt" for short, inputted by pressing the attack button in conjunction with the control stick tilted upward. Up tilts typically involve the character throwing out some basic attack above them. Up tilts tend to be more powerful than forward tilts but with less reach, and usually serve as a quick ground attack that can start combos and juggle opponents, while being capable of KOing at very high damages, though some up tilts are distinctly powerful and can KO as effectively as smash attacks.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Down_tilt" title="Down tilt">Down tilt</a></b>: Referred to as "d-tilt" for short, inputted by pressing the attack button in conjunction with the control stick tilted down. Down tilts typically involve the character throwing out some basic attack that is aimed low in front of them, and are usually the character's fastest tilt, but also their weakest.

<li><b><a href="/Wavedash" title="Wavedash">Wavedashing</a></b>: A technique in <i>Melee</i> and <i>Ultimate</i> that involves the character air dodging into the ground at a diagonal angle, resulting in them sliding a small distance while being able to input any other action.

Characters with the highest traction will barely move, while in <i>Melee</i>, those with the lowest traction will slide nearly half the stage's length. The technique sees far more use in <i>Melee</i> than in <i>Ultimate</i>.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Weight" title="Weight">Weight</a></b>: Each character has a weight value, which affects how far they are launched when hit, with characters suffering less knockback the heavier they are. Heavier characters typically survive for longer than lighter characters, but are in return more vulnerable to being comboed.</li></ul>
