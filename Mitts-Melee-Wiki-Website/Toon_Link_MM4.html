<h1>Toon Link</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Toon Link is a middleweight, yet boasts above-average dashing speed and air acceleration, as well as the ability to wall jump. However, his air speed is average and his falling and fast falling speeds are both slow, while his gravity is low. Although they differ on the majority of their attributes, Toon Link and Link both have above-average walking speeds. Like Link, he also wields his respective version of the Master Sword and possesses two shields, instead of just one. The Master Sword grants Toon Link disjointed range, while the Hero's Shield blocks opposing projectiles if he is standing still or walking. Overall, Toon Link's attributes render him as a fairly quick, yet fairly floaty character.

As a zoning-orientated character, Toon Link possesses a number of projectiles. His Hero's Bow, Boomerang and Bomb enable him to not only force approaches, but also camp effectively. In addition to these strengths, Boomerang and Bomb boast combo potential, with the latter being his most varied and useful combo starter. Thanks to its explosion no longer damaging Toon Link upon contact with an opponent, Bomb now grants him a number of follow-ups at varying percentages. With precise usage, it can be followed by his up smash or forward aerial even at high percentages, both of which are among his most viable KOing options.

Bomb's combo potential is further supplemented by jump-canceling and its status as an item, with the latter trait ensuring that its combo potential is never susceptible to rage or stale-move negation. Although it is not as versatile in comparison, Boomerang is nevertheless useful for Toon Link's combo game, as it can combo into his up tilt, grab and various other moves depending on its positioning.

Although Toon Link's combo game largely revolves around Bomb, he also possesses non-projectile combo starters. Up tilt is the most effective of these: it can combo into itself, up smash, and Spin Attack at low percentages; a short hopped neutral aerial, short hopped back aerial, and short hopped Spin Attack at low to medium percentages; and forward aerial and up aerial at medium to high percentages. Aside from up tilt, grab aerial can be used as a long-ranged set-up similarly to Bomb, regardless of the opponent's damage, while neutral attack can be jab canceled reliably.

Toon Link's back throw, however, is unarguably the most notable improvement to his Hookshot-oriented moves. The removal of its initial hitbox in favor of a single, slightly more damaging throw hitbox has resulted in it now having a consistent, albeit unchanged damage output. When this is coupled with the increase to its knockback values, Toon Link's back throw has not only become one of his most viable KOing options, but also one the strongest throws of any kind in the game.

However, Toon Link has some weaknesses. His grab game is overall very polarized: Hookshot grants him long-lasting grabs that can grab airborne opponents, and a grab aerial and tether recovery that are both very useful, yet his grabs have considerable start-up and ending lag (albeit much less so than in previous installments). By extension, Toon Link's back throw is one of his most viable KO options due to being one of the strongest back throws in the game, while his forward throw is decent for setting up edge-guards and creating space. Conversely, Toon Link's down throw lacks combo potential, which makes it drastically inferior to Link and Young Link's versions. Although Toon Link's up throw is a situational KO option on platforms like Link and Young Link's versions, his back throw utterly outclasses it in this role. As a result, Toon Link's up and down throws are used primarily for setting up aerial pressure, such as by launching an opponent into the trajectory of a previously thrown Boomerang or Bomb.

Toon Link's floatiness makes him particularly susceptible to strong vertical attacks, and renders his recovery quite predictable in spite of its improvements. Unlike other floaty characters, however, Toon Link cannot use his floatiness to perform long aerial combos because of his aerials' considerable ending lag. Toon Link's disjointed range is also somewhat offset by his short size, while the faster pace of Ultimate makes his defensive, projectile-based gameplan less effective than it was in previous installments.

Toon Link is a zoner character, as his long-distance projectiles make him play somewhat defensively for much of the match, and camp with projectiles. Toon Link was initially thought to fare worse in competitive play than in Brawl and SSB4 due to the changes and other veterans being buffed to varying degrees, with most top professionals ranking him as a mid-tier, and usually lower than Link and Young Link. However, as the metagame has progressed, many dedicated Toon Link professionals such as Hyuga, Ri-ma, Sigma, Tsuna and Xcal have seen some strong results with him; as a result, opinions of him have been more positive than before, with most professionals now ranking him closer to the other two Links, and potentially as a high tier character once more.

Toon Link is overall a very balanced and fast fighter with a plethora of attack options via his projectiles, tether grab/recovery, and decent frame data. The combination of low ending lag on his forward and back aerials with his slow fall speed allow Toon Link to dominate in the air with combos, while his moderately fast yet fairly useful tilt attacks and reasonably strong smash attacks allow for relatively easy KOs. While his middling weight and slow falling speed make him easier to combo and KO, it is generally agreed that Toon Link's strengths outweigh his weaknesses by a fair margin.
