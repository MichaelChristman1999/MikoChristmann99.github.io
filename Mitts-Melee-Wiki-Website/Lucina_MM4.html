<h1>Lucina</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Being Marth's distant descendant and his Echo Fighter, Lucina's moveset and animations are generally based off of Marth's, and her attributes are also identical to his, being a tall and rather light middleweight with above-average mobility in most aspects; like him, she has the fastest walking speed in the game, a very fast initial dash speed, a decent running speed, a decent jump height, decent air acceleration and an average falling speed; however, her air speed is merely average, and her gravity value is low, the latter of these two values making her feel somewhat floaty in the air.

As in SSB4, the primary difference between Lucina and Marth is that Lucina lacks a tipper, meaning that her sword attacks deal equal damage throughout her blade. While her sword attacks deal more damage and knockback than Marth's weak sourspots, they deal less damage and knockback than his powerful tipper sweetspots. Theoretically, Marth should deal more overall damage when played optimally and can kill earlier, but Lucina can deal consistent damage and kill more reliably without worrying about precise spacing, and her KOing potential is significantly more consistent in comparison, especially at higher percents.

Overall, whether a person wants to use Lucina or Marth is based on their playstyle. Marth relies on spacing, more defensive play, and early KOs with his powerful tippers. Lucina can be played more aggressively, and relies on her more effective combos to increase the opponent's damage enough so she can KO the opponent. Marth has the potential to be more rewarding if used correctly, but Lucina's consistent damage and knockback gives her a stronger up-close game, makes her attacks significantly safer on shield and on hit than Marth's sourspotted moves, and gives her better matchups against smaller or faster characters that Marth can have a hard time landing his tippers against, such as Pikachu or Fox. Even without a tipper, Lucina is still extremely effective at spacing nevertheless. She also shares Marth's other strengths, such as his decent mobility, above-average frame data, strong juggling and edgeguarding capabilities, and decent out of shield options. As such, she is considered to be one of the easiest and most versatile characters in the game, even when compared to Marth.

Lucina's special moveset also possesses immense utility, and in two cases, more than that of Marth. Shield Breaker can break shields thanks to its high shield damage, even when uncharged, and it is useful for punishing rolls. It also grants some horizontal movement, which is amplified when fully charged, deals additional damage should it directly strike an opponent's head, and deals consistent damage unlike Marth's version. Dancing Blade can be used to punish sidesteps and boasts damage-racking, mix-up, KO and even recovery potential. Unlike Marth's version, the move is easier to properly connect due to its consistent hitboxes. Dolphin Slash has quick startup (coming out on frame 5), provides intangibility during its startup, and is relatively strong upon coming out. These attributes make it Lucina's primary method of recovery, as its speed can make it difficult to intercept, while also making it a decent out of shield option as well. In addition, its power combined with the aerial version's frame 1 intangibility makes it capable of breaking combos, and even stage spiking reckless edgeguarding attempts. Lastly, Counter is a counterattack with a 1.2Ã— damage multiplier that can KO an opponent who uses a sufficiently strong attack, and can also be used to edgeguard many recovery moves with damaging hitboxes.

Despite her strengths and versatility, Lucina is not without flaws, most of them shared with Marth. Perhaps the biggest one is her difficulty in escaping from juggles; her air speed is average at best, her gravity is fairly low, her weight is slightly below-average and her tall hurtbox provides an easy target. Dolphin Slash is her only reliable combo breaker, but as it leaves her helpless, it can inadvertently put her in an even worse position. Also, while Counter can be used defensively, it leaves Lucina extremely vulnerable to punishment should it whiff. Lucina also has little defense against juggling, as her aerials are ineffective at relieving pressure; though her attacks have quick startup and decent range, many of them come with high ending lag, and also suffer from short hitbox durations. Additionally, being a solely sword-based character, her otherwise-excellent neutral game suffers from her lack of a projectile, and she can sometimes struggle against projectile-heavy characters and playstyles; however, her combination of high mobility, good range and decent frame data helps to alleviate this issue.

Like with Marth, Lucina's lackluster grab game is another notable weakness. Except for her up throw, all of her throws have low knockback scaling, preventing them from KOing at realistic percents, while up throw can only KO starting at extremely high percents if Lucina has no rage. Her only other throw with utility is her down throw, which has limited combo potential outside of lower percents due to its high base knockback. However, it should be noted that the high base knockback of her forward and back throws allow Lucina to take advantage of her good edgeguarding capability, especially at the edge.

Lucina herself is somewhat vulnerable to edgeguarding, though she has options for mix-ups with her recovery. Dolphin Slash is her only reliable vertical recovery option, and while it is still a threat to edgeguarders due to its speed, frame 1 intangibility and high stage spike ability, its path is linear and its distance fixed, making it fairly predictable. Additionally, since this move grants little horizontal distance, Lucina is vulnerable to semi-spikes. While Shield Breaker can aid her horizontal recovery, it covers little distance without charging and does not halt her vertical momentum either. Lucina is also heavily reliant on her double jump and directional air dodge for mix-ups in her recovery, and is in significant danger if offstage without either of them.

Overall, Lucina is a "lower-risk, higher-reward" version of Marth, and her strengths outweigh her weaknesses. She trades Marth's stronger KO potential courtesy of his stronger but notoriously inconsistent tippers for more consistent spacing and damage-racking abilities, better close-range capabilities, as well as more consistent KO potential. She has a low learning curve thanks to her straightforward playstyle, since she benefits from spacing at close range while also having several fast and reliably strong KOing options. As a result, Lucina has a very large playerbase, and has achieved excellent results and representation courtesy of players like Mr. E and ProtoBanham; as such, she is considered to be a competitively viable character. In recent times, however, her placings have somewhat diminished over time: other sword characters such as Roy and Chrom have achieved higher placings and representation. As such, while Lucina is still widely considered a top- or high-tier character, her overall position remains debatable.</p>
<h2>Differences from Marth</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the primary difference between Lucina and Marth is that Lucina lacks a tipper, meaning that her sword attacks deal equal damage throughout her blade. This means that Lucina will be able to rack up damage and KO much more consistently, but in turn does not have the option to KO as early as Marth does.

Lucina was also slightly recloned from her previous appearance in SSB4, as she is no longer smaller than Marth (which increases the size of her hurtbox but improves her range), her up tilt will now move her forward slightly, and she no longer keeps her momentum on her neutral attack and up tilt. Despite losing these somewhat negligible differences, she keeps one other difference from SSB4: her up tilt has a unique sweetspot based on how late into the swing the opponent is hit. This ensures that she can rack up damage more easily with her up tilt as long as she is facing away from her opponent.

While Lucina and Marth have largely identical attacks, mobility attributes and frame data, the lack of a tipper spreads across Lucina's entire moveset, making her one of the more unique Echo Fighters alongside her father Chrom and Ken. As such, these three characters are expected to have their own spots on the tier list, and are expected to be permitted to be used alongside their base fighters in Squad Strike. Lucina has obtained excellent results and representation early in the Ultimate metagame, especially compared to Marth; as such, she is considered to be a top tier and possibly the best swordfighter in the game, though Roy and Shulk are considered to be candidates for the title as the meta develops. Marth has also received several buffs exclusive to him via in-game updates, improving his competitive standing considerably. While this does not affect Lucina directly, it does put her stance as the clear superior of the two into question.</p>
