<h1>Zelda</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Zelda is a tall, floaty lightweight character with overall slow mobility. While she has a slightly above-average air speed, the 20th highest traction, and a decent initial dash, her jumping force and air acceleration are below average, and she has the 22nd slowest walking speed, the 16th slowest falling speed, the 10th lowest gravity, and is tied with Byleth for the 9th slowest running speed in the game. Zelda's attacks are based on magic, making most of them disjointed or otherwise long-range attacks. They also boast generally quick startup; all of her attacks activate before frame 10, except for forward tilt, up aerial, down aerial, and forward smash. Despite her lightweight status, most of her attacks have KO potential and impressive damage output, giving her power comparable to heavyweights. Due to these factors, Zelda can be generalized as a zoner glass cannon.

Her neutral attack is a small burst of magical energy in front of her, boasting decent range and good damage output before transitioning into a rapid jab of many magical bursts with a finishing hit. Forward tilt is a strong arm swipe with good range and little ending vulnerability, with the additional ability to be angled. Up tilt is a vertical, long-lasting, circular arm sweep, useful as an anti-air and combo tool across most percentages of damage. Down tilt is a quick crouching kick that lasts surprisingly long and is good for many combo setups and 2-framing opponents. Her dash attack is a dual hand thrust with a burst of magic most powerful closest to her hands. It’s best used throughout combos to gain distance. Her forward and up smashes are both powerful, multi-hitting bursts of magic energy; the former being a thrust of the hand forward and the latter being a wave of the hand back and forth above her. Down smash is a very fast 360° leg sweep that launches opponents at a semi spike angle with decent knockback.

Zelda's more prominent strengths are in the air, as she has some of the strongest aerials in the game. Zelda can auto-cancel both her neutral and down aerials in a short hop, and forward and back aerial auto-cancel from a fast fall. Though her neutral air lacks notable KO ability, it pairs a long active duration with generously-sized hitboxes. This, combined with its aforementioned early autocancel window, makes her neutral air her most versatile aerial, excelling at starting and/or extending combos, setting up edgeguards, and pressuring shields if spaced well. Her forward and back aerials are known as Lightning Kicks. Both of these aerials possess a powerful sweetspot at her foot, dealing 24% with high knockback. Surprisingly, unlike most moves with such high power, it also sports minimal startup, coming out at frame 6. Up air is a large, disjointed explosion with excellent damage and knockback; thanks to patch 7.0.0, it is also long-lasting. Down air, sometimes nicknamed the "Lightning Stomp", is a meteor smash which touts a powerful sweetspot on her foot, similar to her Lightning Kicks. Among the most powerful meteor smashes in the game, the sweetspot is naturally a strong edgeguarding tool, and, due to its early autocancel window and low ending lag, it also has utility in starting and extending combos. It's also among Zelda's most consistent aerials in that the very long-lasting sourspot always meteor smashes, so even if the sweetspot whiffs, it can still take stocks. However, despite the potency of her aerial attacks, all of them lack safety on character's shields, meaning she can fall victim to strong out of shield punishes if she's not careful with her use of them.

Her special moves take inspiration from various Zelda titles. Her neutral special move, Nayru's Love, is a reflector that doubles as a melee attack; Zelda also is intangible from frames 4-13 of the move. These traits make it useful against projectile users as well as evading/halting opponent’s combos. Din's Fire, her side special move, sends out an explosive ball of fire that explodes on the release of the button or when reaching max charge, becoming more powerful and flying further the longer it is charged. It possesses a powerful sweetspot in the inner part of the explosion, with an otherwise large explosion hitbox. The ball of fire does not count as a projectile, but the explosion can be absorbed. In addition, for the first time in the series, Zelda can use it to cover her recovery, as it no longer leaves her helpless in midair. Her up special move, Farore's Wind, is a great KO option, possessing very fast startup and elevator combos from the first hit on the ground to its very powerful second hit in the air. This, combined with it being a omnidirectional teleport recovery that travels a very respectable distance, renders it a very potent recovery move and perhaps one of the most versatile in the game. As a teleport recovery, it's difficult to edgeguard against by default due to its intangibility between exit and reentry. On top of this, it can have anti-ledgetrap and mindgame potential if one opts to use the aforementioned powerful second hitbox instead of snapping to ledge. And, much like Palutena's Warp, she can completely avoid the move's ending lag by using a technique called edge cancelling, which grants her access to otherwise-impossible approach and stage control options. Lastly, her down special, Phantom Slash, is perhaps her most versatile tool. It's a unique projectile that she builds piece-by-piece until it is fully formed, though she can use it at any stage of its creation by pressing either the special or attack button, which affects several of its properties. The earliest stages have rather low damage, knockback, and range, but it becomes increasingly more potent as it becomes more complete, with the final stage having high damage output, impressive knockback, and stellar range. It takes a little over a second to reach the final stage, after which Zelda will be able to move and attack freely in an untethered sort of state. The Phantom will attack on its own after about another second if it is not triggered, granting Zelda a lot of flexibility when using it, such as retreating behind it for protection, attacking in tandem with it, launching the opponent towards it, performing shield breaking combos, making grab setups, and even covering her recovery (similar to Din's Fire).

Zelda has an outstanding grab, as she makes up for her noticeable vulnerability with long range. Her grab attack, however, is mostly average in speed and damage. Her throws are very useful for her fighting and overall advantage state maneuvers. Forward throw is good to setup edge guarding, while back and up throw are very strong KO throws. Down throw is most useful as a combo starter.

Despite her toolkit's versatility and potency, Zelda still packs noticeable flaws. Chief among them is arguably her poor mobility—especially on the ground—which hampers her ability to approach effectively against those who outspeed her. As a result of this, she flounders against quick, fast-falling opponents like Wolf and Zero Suit Samus. This mobility issue is exacerbated through numerous frame data issues, as many of her attacks, while quick to startup, have punishing amounts of end lag. Since she is light, tall, and floaty, she is also vulnerable to juggling and can be KO'd earlier than a good part of the roster. Her very poor disadvantage state makes her vulnerable to momentum changes as well. While rage improves her excellent KO potential even further, her mediocre endurance doesn't allow her to take advantage of it as much as heavier characters. This riskiness is especially apparent in her KO options; though they're incredibly potent, they struggle with unreliable or weak sourspots (in dash attack and Lighting Kicks), punishable ending lag (in up smash, up aerial, and forward smash to an extent) or a combination of the two (in Din's Fire and Farore's Wind). Along with this, some parts of her moveset struggle with landing reliably. Her neutral aerial's multihits, though improved through patches, still sometimes struggle to connect with each other, and her neutral attack and forward tilt's hitboxes are placed high and narrow, respectively, so they sometimes have trouble hitting short or crouching fighters. Finally, her special moves have a couple of minor downsides; Nayru's Love has noticeable ending lag, making it punishable if overused, and if Zelda gets hit before sending the Phantom with Phantom Slash, it will fall apart and she will have to reuse the move.

Overall, Zelda has an excellent advantage state and can easily KO opponents thanks to a variety of strong attacks and KO setups, but she has to be careful with how she spaces her attacks, how she approaches, and what she does to get out of a disadvantage.</p>
