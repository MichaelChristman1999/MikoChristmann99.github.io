<h1>Daisy</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Daisy is a somewhat light character who is quite slow in terms of walking speed and dashing speed, and has an extremely slow falling speed and very low gravity, while her air speed is only average. While this is an unfavorable combination of traits, it is compensated by her unique floating ability and her very high air acceleration. Daisy's aerial game is one of her greatest strengths. Her floating ability grants her the power to hover at any height she chooses, giving her a distinct advantage in aerial combat. Floating also helps her to control space; floating low to the ground and using retreating aerials makes her difficult to punish, and this greatly helps her own approach as well. With good spacing, she can attack the opponent's shield with little fear of reprisal. Float can increase her mobility and movement options, allowing her to frustrate her opponents with quick and unpredictable mixups. Additionally, floating aids Daisy's off-stage presence when combined with her slow falling speed, despite her low jumps and the high ending lag of her aerial attacks (except for down aerial); not only does it help her cover certain angles when edgeguarding, it can also be used to aid her horizontal recovery or potentially even allow her to go underneath stages to stall. Neutral aerial is her fastest aerial with the lowest landing lag, and deals an impressively high amount of damage despite its speed while also possessing a decently long duration; when combined with her ability to float close to the ground, neutral aerial's combination of fast startup, low base knockback and low landing lag makes it an incredibly good combo tool at lower percents that can even lead into itself with enough technical skill, especially after a down tilt, while its damage output and knockback scaling ensures that it still has decent KO potential at higher ones. Her forward aerial is her slowest aerial attack, but it is also her strongest one, and it can be used while floating to search for a finishing move with relative safety, especially given its disjointed hitbox and fairly low landing lag relative to its strength; however, it possesses a weaker sourspot on her arm. Her back aerial possesses a decent combination of fast startup with good range and power in addition to being her most reliable follow-up from a down throw, and although it suffers from notable ending lag compared to other back aerials, Daisy's float and slow falling speed compensate for this. Up aerial hits twice and is impressively disjointed, while the first hit can potentially drag down opponents after a short hop height down aerial for grounded follow-ups; however, its horizontal range compared to Daisy's other aerial attacks is somewhat lacking. Finally, her down aerial has the lowest ending lag of all her aerial attacks, and can be used as a potential combo starter at low to middle percents thanks to the final hit's vertical angle. Comparatively, her grounded attacks are less effective in direct comparison, but are not without utility. Neutral attack comes out on frame 2, making it not only Daisy's fastest attack, but also one of the fastest neutral attacks in the entire game; conversely, it is fairly weak compared to other two-hit jabs. Up tilt has a disjointed hitbox above her and can be used as an anti-air attack. Forward tilt is a potential follow-up from down throw, has decent horizontal and vertical range while being disjointed, and uniquely has a vertical launch angle. Down tilt is her fastest tilt attack, and while it is less disjointed than her other tilts, it possesses decent combo potential; with sufficient technical skill, it is possible to follow up the move with multiple neutral aerials performed from ground-level floats. Dash attack is relatively fast and decently disjointed, with the first hit reliably leading into the second, and it can also serve as a potential KO move at very high percents. She has a decent grab game, as her down throw can be followed up with a back aerial, forward tilt or neutral aerial, forward and back throws can easily setup edgeguards, and back throw can even serve as a KO move at extremely high percents. Daisy also has a potent if somewhat situational set of smash attacks, all of them possessing reasonably good range: her forward smash can be angled up or down, giving her access to three different weapons (golf club if unangled, frying pan if angled up, or tennis racket if angled down), each with their own useful properties; down smash is a multi-hit attack good for catching rolls and edge recovery options; and her up smash is a particularly powerful move when sweetspotted, while also granting intangibility to her head and arms. Her special moves have their uses as well. Toad is a counterattack where if either Daisy or Toad himself are attacked, the latter will retaliate with spores hitting multiple times; like most other counterattacks, the move can be used as an edgeguarding tool against certain recovery moves with damaging hitboxes, most notably Ike's Aether and Chrom's Soaring Slash. Unlike most other counterattacks, Toad does not scale relative to the strength of the attack countered, while Toad's spores can be curiously be reflected or absorbed, the former of the latter two in particular rendering the move useless against many reflectors, such as Mario's Cape or Fox's aptly-named Reflector. Daisy Bomber is a move where Daisy lunges forward and strikes with her butt; it can be used as a horizontal recovery option in addition to her aforementioned floating ability, its travel distance is increased if the move is smash-inputted, and in addition to being decently strong if successfully landed, it is also very difficult to punish out of shield because of how she rebounds after successfully hitting a target, though it suffers from high ending lag if whiffed. Daisy Parasol is a serviceable vertical recovery move, and can be used as an out-of-shield option thanks to its fast startup and decent range. It is also fairly difficult to contest from above thanks to its large disjoint above her and lingering hitbox if the parasol is kept open after ascending. Finally, Vegetable serves as her projectile, and as a throwable item, it is quite a versatile one; the move also has a 1/250 chance of spawning a powerful Bob-omb and a 1/166 chance of spawning a shield-shattering Mr. Saturn. While Daisy has exceptional strengths, that does not mean she has no weaknesses. Faster opponents may be able to overwhelm her before she can begin throwing vegetables or otherwise defend herself. If thrown into the air, she can have difficulty landing, and when combined with her floatiness, this makes her susceptible to juggling and vertical combos. Daisy's ability to approach suffers against swordfighters like Shulk and Cloud or zoners like R.O.B. and Samus, as she lacks the agility to get in close before they can hit her. Her recovery, while very good, is also a potential point of failure, as while she can travel a great deal of horizontal distance, she can also be left vulnerable if forced to rely on Daisy Parasol and her vertical recovery is average at best (discounting the incredibly dangerous and situational Bob-omb), as well as predictable. Additionally, her vegetables, being item projectiles, can be picked up by opponents and used against her, despite being fairly useful overall. Overall, Daisy is a technical character that, once mastered, is a major threat to any opponent. Her floating ability, very high air acceleration, and solid aerial attacks give Daisy a fantastic air game that allows her to easily outmaneuver her opponents, and initiate devastating set-ups, which is further supplemented with useful specials. However, Daisy players have to be aware of her slow grounded movement, somewhat light weight, and extreme floatiness by maximizing her floating ability to constantly transition between the ground and the air, and carefully utilize her moveset to avoid being punished for even a simple mistake.</p>
