<h1>Falco Lombardi</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Falco is a lightweight character with the highest jump in the game, a fast initial dash speed, the 7th highest gravity, the 10th fastest walking speed, the 11th fastest falling speed, the 12th highest traction and the 9th best air acceleration, but in contrast has average dashing speed and the 23rd slowest air speed. This makes his movement somewhat polarizing as he has overall mediocre horizontal movement (especially while airborne), but excels in reaching insane vertical heights.

Owing to his status as a "talented aerial fighter" with an "amazing jumping ability" and fast falling speed, Falco's greatest strengths lie in his strong combo, juggling, and edgeguarding capabilities; with his aerials being most evident of these traits. Up aerial in particular, is his primary juggling tool, thanks its quick startup, wide hitbox that can hit opponents on landing, and low overall lag and knockback. These traits make it very effective at starting and extending juggles, and as well as being capable of comboing into itself and other aerials. Additionally, it can KO at high percents near the upper blast line. Neutral aerial has a large, lasting hitbox that covers Falco and is a fast multi-hit, making it a good disruptor and combo extender/finisher. It can also drag opponents downward, allowing it to start combos on stage. Forward aerial has decent horizontal range and is also a lasting multi-hit, allowing it to edgeguard and KO reliably. Like his neutral aerial, it can drag opponents downward as well, putting offstage opponents in a very bad spot. Back aerial is one of the strongest aerials of its kind and can reliably KO even from center-stage. Lastly, down aerial, while nowhere near as notorious as its previous iterations, comes out fast and is a lasting hitbox; with its clean hit being a powerful meteor smash, giving it the ability to start combos onstage and score early KOs against poor recoveries.

Although Falco's ground game looks limited, he has a handful of respectable options at his disposal. Up tilt, in particular is Falco's staple in initiating combos thanks to its very quick startup, great coverage, and low ending lag and knockback. It can combo into itself and any of his aerials, and even setup for KO's into back aerial or up aerial at high percents. Down tilt, despite being Falco's most powerful tilt, is also capable of follow-ups into aerials thanks to its sourspots' lower power. Additionally, it covers a good distance in front of himself, allowing him to burst KO grounded opponents or call out low recoveries aiming for the ledge. Forward smash has a wide front hitbox and can kill fairly early if performed near the ledge, while down smash comes out quick and sends at a semi-spike angle, working as another burst KO option and heavily threatening those with poor recoveries. His other moves, although more situational, still have their uses: neutral attack comes out exceedingly quick and its first two hits can lock, forward tilt can be angled and is relatively fast, allowing it to be used as a decent spacing option, and dash attack has a long duration, enabling it to catch dodges and landings, with its clean hit sending at a favorable angle for juggles and its late hit sending opponents at a much lower angle for edgeguards.

Complementing Falco's aerials and tilts is his grab game, as overshielding his feared up tilt and aerials provides Falco the opportunity to make use of his highly damaging throws. Up throw is Falco's best throw, as much like up tilt, it is an effective combo starter into any of his aerials at all percents and can perform KO setups or even outright KO with its second hit. Forward throw and down throw, while lacking true combos, can lead into follow-ups lower near the ground at low to mid percents. Finally, back throw's first hit is a semispike that sets up for Falco's strong edgeguarding game, while its second hit can outright KO at high percents near the blast line.

Considering his special moveset, Falco's specials can provide unique benefits. Blaster is his primary ranged option, with it being an effective disruptor due to its fast projectile and greatly reduced ending lag. Its shots can be used to pressure, provoke or halt approaches, snipe double jumps, or even outright gimp poor recoveries. Falco Phantasm has Falco dash very quickly, making it great for horizontal recovery. Its grounded version can start combos at low to mid percents and even set up KOs with back aerial at high percents, while its aerial version can meteor smash careless edgeguarders. Fire Bird is his main recovery option and grants respectable distance in any chosen direction. It can also work as a niche damage option due to having damaging hitboxes throughout and can deal well over 30% if all hits connect. Lastly, Reflector activates on frame 1, making reacting against quick projectiles less of a liability for Falco; it also has a hitbox which activates slightly later that serves as a decent poking tool.

In spite of Falco's well-balanced strengths, he has numerous weaknesses. His most prominent flaws are his survivability and his inconsistency. Despite being a lightweight, Falco is vulnerable to combos due to his fast falling speed and lack of escape options. Although Falco's recovery grants respectable distance, it is very linear. Falco Phantasm no longer passes shields, making it far easier to corner him from his recovery. Without his double jump, Falco is in great danger offstage due to the nerfs to air dodging and how Fire Bird is still slow and predictable.

Regarding his moveset, Falco has several moves that do not function properly and can even work against him. Up tilt has a sourspot near the end of its first hit with set knockback, making it unsafe on hit. Up smash, despite having fast startup and high vertical reach, has large blindspots that only allow medium-sized or larger characters that are only directly next to and in front of Falco to be hit, leaving him extremely vulnerable from behind and against small or crouching opponents (even if they're directly in front of Falco). Additionally, plaguing him since Smash 4, both up tilt and up smash are prone to failing to properly connect against aerial opponents. Despite its looks, neutral aerial has difficulty hitting opponents from behind, and due to changes in the game's engine, the move's looping hits are more prone to failing to connect than it was in the previous installment. While Blaster and Reflector have reduced lag, the former is still unsafe on hit even from a distance, while the latter still has a misleadingly small hitbox and its removed trip chance ironically makes it even more unsafe on hit overall than in Smash 4. Most notoriously, however, are Falco's back and up throws. Due to changes in the game's physics, the laser from both throws are even more prone to being DI'd than before, allowing opponents to survive in excess of what would've been a KO.

These aforementioned problems compound Falco's other more defined weakness of struggling to secure a KO. Like fellow Star Fox fighters Fox and Wolf, Falco's strongest moves are also his slowest in terms of startup and/or endlag, requiring careful execution to avoid heavy punishment. Lastly, Falco's damage output and range have been nerfed from Smash 4. This is especially noteworthy due to most of the cast receiving various buffs not limited to these aspects and the prominence of swordfighters and zoners in Ultimate.

Overall, Falco has the tools that let him defensively pressure his opponent, then effectively capitalize on their errors with his strong combo and edgeguarding capabilities. However, he can struggle keeping up with faster opponents and as well as against those who have large disjoints. Although he can score early KOs through a well-executed edgeguard or hard read, Falco must be careful not to let opponents take advantage of his own weaknesses to avoid being combo'd and KO'd early himself.</p>
