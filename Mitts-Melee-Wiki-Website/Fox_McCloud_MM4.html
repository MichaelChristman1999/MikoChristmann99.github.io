<h1>Fox McCloud</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Sheik is a character that, like a ninja of sorts, fits the "hit-and-run" character archetype. One of Sheik's greatest strengths is her overall mobility, being among the best in the game both grounded and aerial. She also has the 4th highest gravity, which makes her mobility better, but leaves her more vulnerable to horizontal knockback. Her crouch is also very low, making her difficult to hit when doing so. Sheik can also wall cling and crawl. However, she is the 6th-lightest character in the game, which when coupled with her gravity and tall height, these traits collectively make her very susceptible to combos and KO's, thus giving her very frail survivability overall.

Aside from her excellent mobility, another one of Sheik's greatest strengths is her extremely quick frame data. Her moves have generally negligible amounts of startup or ending lag, making her extremely difficult to punish properly; this is supplemented by the good range of her moveset. She also has an excellent projectile in Needle Storm, with the needles charging and traveling fast, being long-ranged (covers about half of Final Destination), possessing transcendent priority, causing hitstun, and having overall low cool down (especially when used in the air or on landing). These traits collectively give Sheik a strong camping ability and as well as allowing for versatile follow-ups off of her needles.

Overall, the combination of Sheik's mobility, projectiles, range and frame data form her greatest strength: her outstanding neutral game. She can play both defensively, by pressuring and zoning from afar without much trouble, or aggressively, with her fast attack speed giving her an unpredictable approach. Sheik can poke and pressure her opponents with her aerials and tilts, all of which are safe options. If they choose to drop their shield, they are wide open to these attacks. At the same time, holding shield presents her with an opportunity to grab and use her throw set-ups.

Sheik's excellent frame data, combined with the low power of many of her moves, give her among the best combo abilities in the game. Her throws can easily lead to other attacks, with her forward and down throws being particularly effective at starting combos, as they can set up long chains of forward aerials, with her up aerial and Bouncing Fish being useful combo finishers. Her combos are not limited to her air game; all of her tilts can start and extend combos since they send opponents into the air, and can confirm into aerials; her forward tilt particularly has reliable follow-ups all the way into KO percents. Down tilt, while not chaining into itself as effectively, has even lower power, giving her access to KO confirms as well.

All aspects of Sheik's moveset are solid overall. The majority of her aerial moves possess great versatility; forward aerial, in particular, has a fast startup, decent ending lag, auto-cancels in a short hop fast fall, and has slightly disjointed range, making it an all-purpose move: it can be used to approach, pressure, combo and set up edge-guards. Up aerial similarly possesses great utility: its looping hits can be used to drag down opponents to extend combos or lead into KOs depending on positioning, much like Joker's own up aerial. Additionally, it is her strongest aerial, and also launches opponents at a great angle for juggling, both of which give it good utility at both KOing and finishing combos. Her back aerial is also versatile to an extent, as it can be used to extend or finish combos as well. When sweet spotted (at the foot), it can KO at high percents near the ledge and is even safer on shield than her forward aerial. Lastly, neutral aerial is her fastest aerial, allowing her to break out of combos and extend or finish hers, notably into Bouncing Fish.

Outside of Needle Storm, Sheik's special moveset also possesses good utility. Her up special, Vanish, grants her intangibility and invisibility, which collectively make it difficult for the opponent to predict where she will reappear. It also has a hitbox on disappearance that is moderately strong, and another one and a windbox when she reappears, making it difficult to punish. Meanwhile, Sheik's down special Bouncing Fish, is famous for being her primary KO move, being similar to Flip Jump on some regards: it deals respectable damage with high knockback scaling, can finish combos from her neutral aerial, forward aerial, back aerial, and aerial Needle Storm, and is safe on shield when retreating. Sheik can perform consecutive stronger kicks after the first, although this sees almost no use in normal gameplay.

Both Vanish and Bouncing Fish also conform Sheik's last strength in her recovery, as they make it versatile and extendable, both of them can be used in tandem with each other, and they are difficult and risky to intercept, as they both deal high knockback enough to interrupt an edge-guard. Combined with her wall jump, this makes Sheik hard to edge-guard or gimp, without disabling her double jump, and enables her to reverse edge-guard effectively.

However, despite having immense strengths, Sheik has polarizing flaws. The most notable of them is her frailty: despite the fact that her recovery is amazing, in a similar vein to Fox, her on-stage endurance is very weak due to her very lightweight (being lighter than characters such as Kirby), succumbing to even decently strong blows, whereas her above average height, high falling speed and gravity make her easy to combo. This is further compounded by her notoriously poor damage output overall: despite her strong damage racking ability, she requires extremely long strings of attacks just to do the same amount of damage that the vast majority of the cast can inflict in noticeably far fewer hits, making her arguably the weakest fighter in the game in terms of general damage and knockback in her moveset.

While the low damage and power on her moves grant her an awesome combo game, Sheik also struggles to securely score KOs due to her handful of KO options and each of them being difficult to land precisely. Her up smash has a powerful first hit on her arms as she raises them, but it is difficult to land outside of a read or confirm, is hampered by its much weaker second hit as she lowers her arms and is very punishable if missed, her forward and down smash are among the weakest smash attacks of their kind, and they have punishable ending lag as well, while Vanish's disappearing hitbox is hard to land. In the air, she is limited to using her up aerial, back aerial, or Bouncing Fish to KO, and even then, the former two require to be used close to the blast lines due to their relatively weak knockback, whereas the latter is susceptible to DI and is predictable without a setup on top of KOing considerably later center-stage compared to the edge.

Furthermore, Sheik's aerial KO setups are difficult to pull off due to Ultimate's faster pace and launch physics, re-addition of directional air dodges, and the weakening of her neutral and back aerials' respective combo potentials. Her other aerials are otherwise only useful for edge-guarding and gimping characters with particularly weak or linear recoveries due to their abysmal KO power or sacrificial use. Sheik's grab game is also below-average overal: she lacks throws that can KO at realistic percents, and while her aforementioned forward and down throws are useful combo starters, they have too much knockback for truly reliable KO set-ups.

With all of these weaknesses working against her, it is not uncommon for Sheik's opponents to survive in excess of 150%. When combined with her frailty, she is notoriously vulnerable to comebacks, even against fighters with generally mediocre KO potentials. Lastly, the rage mechanic hinders Sheik: without rage, she often has trouble KO'ing, though as her rage increases, her combo game slowly dwindles, which when combined with her poor damage output, can make bringing an opponent to KO percents difficult. Additionally, this brings opponents to a high level of rage enough to KO Sheik herself.

Other weaknesses include a few moves that have very low utility, despite Sheik's moveset versatility. These include her down aerial, which is her overall slowest aerial, has the highest landing lag and is a stall-then-fall, giving it the lowest utility of Sheik's aerial moveset despite it meteor smashing an opponent. Her dash attack, although very quick, is unsafe on shield due to its inability to cross-up and does not KO at realistic percents. Her up throw similarly does not KO at realistic percents and is her least useful throw, as it lacks the utility her other throws have. Sheik's smash attacks are unsafe and difficult to land overall, although they are fast enough to work as combo finishers. Lastly, Burst Grenade is powerful but has a slow explosion, which limits it to situational usage on edge-guarding predictable recoveries, extending the damage of a hard punish, or a situational mix-up to deter edge-guarders.

Altogether, Sheik's strengths slightly outweigh her weaknesses. While she has an outstanding neutral game owing to her excellent frame data and mobility, she often has to play a very long game due to how long it usually takes to get her opponent to a KO percentage. At that point, Sheik has to play an entirely different playstyle and try to look for openings to land her KO confirms. Nevertheless, Sheik's strengths and the myriad of buffs she received from game updates have resulted in many top players having an overall positive view on her viability, especially compared to the early meta when she was commonly considered a low-tier character. On a related note, Sheik's best player from Super Smash Bros. 4, VoiD, has readopted her as his main and has achieved respectable tournament results, which has further reinforced her viability in spite of her playerbase being drastically smaller than it was in SSB4.</p>
