<h1>Piranha Plant</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Piranha Plant is a heavyweight fighter with below-average mobility and effective anti-air tools. Compared to other heavyweights, it fits in the mold of an archetypal heavyweight: while its dashing speed is average and its gravity is very high, it has a slow walking speed, air acceleration, and air speed, and a fast falling speed.

One of Piranha Plant's most effective strengths is its diverse special moves. Its neutral special, Ptooie, is a unique projectile that can be tossed in either direction or held in the air as a good anti-air option, and a good trading tool due to its power and transcendent priority. Poison Breath is a slow-moving projectile that does not make opponents flinch, but deals massive damage, especially when fully charged; opponents must be very wary of it, making it a good area-denial tool. Its up special, Piranhacopter, has hitboxes beside itself and travels a great distance, pairing well with Piranha Plant's heavy weight and fast falling speed to give it excellent survivability. Its down special, Long-Stem Strike, grants super armor during its pot phase and tremendous range when fully charged, at the cost of extending its hurtbox significantly.

Piranha Plant's ground game is overall rather versatile; its tilts are good for starting juggles or combos, as well as spacing and KOing. Up tilt can lead into various aerial attacks, and a forward smash at low percents; forward tilt behaves similarly to Snake's in that it is a natural combo consisting of two hits, of which the second hit can KO at very high percentages; and down tilt is a versatile combo starter, being capable of leading into moves such as forward tilt or forward aerial at low to mid percentages, and into aerials afterward. Its smash attacks are generally slow but powerful, such as its forward smash, which is somewhat slow in terms of startup and ending lag, but can KO opponents near the ledge as early as 60% if sweetspotted.

Its aerials are overall well-rounded, making its air game overall decent despite its rather sluggish mobility and moves with relatively high landing lag. Neutral aerial is a multi-hit move that functions much like Palutena and Ivysaur's neutral aerials, being a capable combo move with the ability to drag opponents down for combos and potentially makes it a gimping tool due to this trait. Forward aerial is good for edgeguarding thanks to its wide range, whereas back aerial is a slow but very powerful move that KOs at 80% near the ledge. Up aerial is one of its best comboing and juggling tools, thanks to its speed and wide range and can autocancel in short hop. Lastly, down aerial is a long-ranged and decently strong meteor smash with very fast startup.

Another strength Piranha Plant possesses is a decent grab game; while its grab range is short, its grabs' frame data is among the fastest in the game, and its throws have their own unique perks; forward throw is a useful throw for positioning and edgeguarding, back and up throws have KO potential at high percentages, and down throw is a viable combo starter at low to high percentages.

Piranha Plant does, however, have some noteworthy flaws. Its overall mobility is lackluster, having an average initial dash speed and dash speed, but poor air acceleration and slow airspeed. This gives it difficulties keeping up with faster characters such as Zero Suit Samus or Wolf, especially in the air, which makes it rather easy to zone out. Piranha Plant's heavyweight and tall hurtbox makes it vulnerable to combos, particularly from those with strong combo games such as Peach or Mario, and has trouble landing from juggles due to its lack of fast enough tools to escape from them. Finally, Piranha Plant's approach options are rather predictable, with its overall frame data being generally slow. This is no exception to its KOing options either, and most of Piranha Plant's KO moves are either short-ranged or laggy.

Another problem Piranha Plant has is that its two projectiles, which are a crucial part of its toolkit, are notably vulnerable to reflectors due to the slow startup of Ptooie and the fact that Poison Breath can be reflected at any point during its duration, which forces it to use its projectiles more shrewdly when facing opponents with reflectors.

Overall, Piranha Plant is a unique heavyweight fighter that utilizes various projectiles and attacks to effectively zone and KO opponents, but must be careful when throwing out normal attacks to avoid being punished due to the end lag that many of them have, thus making it a patient fighter when it comes to approaching. Although Piranha Plant had amassed great popularity as a character itself at its early stages, its representation has been below-average in tournaments due to its weaknesses and general unpopularity in competitive play. This has led to most professionals considering Piranha Plant as a mid tier character. In recent times, however, players have achieved stronger impacts compared to releases such as Brood placing 2nd at Umebura SP 4. Other smashers such as Lucky and Greward have also done work at regional and national-level tournaments. This makes its viability debatable.</p>
