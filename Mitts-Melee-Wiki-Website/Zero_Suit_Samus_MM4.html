<h1>Zero Suit Samus</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Zero Suit Samus is a tall, lightweight character, similar to Zelda and Rosalina, which alongside her low weight (tied with Meta Knight for the seventh lowest) gives her poor endurance. However, much like other rushdown characters of her playstyle, her mobility is among the best in the game; she possesses the 2nd fastest initial dash in the game, the 7th fastest run speed, the 9th fastest air speed, the 15th fastest air acceleration, and the 3rd highest jump height overall. Altogether, this combination of traits gives her an excellent hit-and-run playstyle.

One of her biggest strengths is her outstanding air game, considered among the best in the cast. While her neutral aerial has noticeable start-up, it is decently disjointed and sends at an excellent angle for combos. This makes it one of her main tools in the neutral and is notable for having several KO confirms into some of her finishing moves. Her forward aerial is also a great combo starter due to its low lag and can be useful for edgeguarding, while it has some KO potential offstage. Her back aerial is fast and has good KO power and can be combo'd into from a neutral aerial at high percents, making it one of her main KO options. Her up aerial is one of her fastest aerials and can be combo'd into itself repeatedly, making it a great juggling tool, namely into Boost Kick. Her down aerial is a stall-then-fall aerial with a meteor smash hitbox; while it is her slowest aerial and easily her most unsafe to use offstage, it can nonetheless be used as a situational KO move. Finally, she is one of the only characters in the game with a grab aerial, which like most other grab aerials has long range and low lag overall, giving her a good approach against aerial foes, while also giving her a niche recovery option.

While her ground game isn't as powerful as her aerials, it still has decent utility. Her neutral attack is notable for coming out instantly on frame 1, making it a reliable anti-pressure tool despite its poor damage output and range. Her forward tilt has good range as well as low lag and can set up tech-chase situations and can trip at low percents when angled downwards, her up tilt is the fastest of its kind at 3 frames of startup and can be used as an anti-air, and her down tilt lowers her hurtbox and is useful as a ranged poking option while also being a decent combo starter. Her down smash has decently sized hitboxes with low ending lag and is an effective combo tool starting from lower percentages while at higher percentages, it can lead into KO moves such as Boost Kick or up smash; however, unlike most other down smashes, it only hits in front of her, meaning it can miss. Lastly, her up smash has impressive vertical range overall, deals high hitstun, has low enough ending lag for some combos at low percentages, and has decent KO power, easily making it one of the best up smashes in Ultimate.

Zero Suit Samus also has a decent grab game, as her grab has a very long range, while all of her throws deal at least 8% damage. Her forward throw can be used for tech chasing, while her back throw can force opponents into unfavorable offstage situations or even lead into her infamous Flip Jump meteor smash. Her up throw is a very strong KO throw (which KO's starting around 170%), and while her down throw is ironically unsuitable for combos unlike other down throws, it can still follow up at low percentages if she acts fast enough.

Finally, her special moveset has strong utility overall. Paralyzer, her neutral special, has a very fast charge time compared to other chargeable projectiles, and starting at mid percentages, will stun opponents long enough for her to be able to follow up. Plasma Whip, her side special, is a long-ranged attack with very strong utility: tapping the button will cause the move to become a multi-hitting KO option that KO's starting at 140% if fresh, while holding the button will cause the move to hit once and knock foes upward. While this version is less suited for offense and has more lag, it still has utility for setting up combos. Boost Kick, her up special, travels a short distance overall for a lightweight, but compensates with having many options that follow up into it (such as neutral and up aerials, Paralyzer and Flip Jump's burying sweetspot), while the last hit is strong enough to KO earlier than her forward smash. Finally, her down special, Flip Jump, is a 45 degree acrobatic jump that does not render her helpless in the air, while its followup kick can meteor smash foes in the air or bury them on the ground, and is fast enough that it will often leave slower characters (such as Ganondorf) in disadvantageous situations.

Zero Suit Samus is not without flaws, however. Perhaps her most infamous flaw lies in her defense: while her recovery is among the most effective in Ultimate due to her abundance of recovery options, her fast air speed and high jumps, her aforementioned weight and tall frame give her very poor endurance, while her recovery options (except for Flip Jump) give ironically short distance on their own, which can make her recovery predictable. This flaw is further stressed with her fast falling speed, as it is easy for characters with sufficiently fast combo attacks (including Mario and Pichu) to perform combos on her (although her frame 2 air dodges can somewhat alleviate this issue).

Her ground game, despite its strengths, is also flawed. While her tilts have passable range, and her up and down smashes are good for followups and KO confirms, her forward smash has high end lag for an attack of its kind and is not strong enough to KO reliably, making it arguably her worst move. Her dash attack is also slow and does not reliably combo unless the opponent DIs incorrectly due to its ending lag, and her down smash, despite its followup potential, is unsafe on hit at low percentages due to its low hitlag and knockback, meaning that the paralyzed opponent(s) can act before she can follow up.

Zero Suit Samus's out-of-shield game can also be rather problematic. While Boost Kick is very fast at frame 6 and can KO very early at the ledge, it lacks sufficient range in front of her and has a very hard time punishing cross-ups out of shield. While the aerial version has more range, it also costs 3 extra frames to start up (due to her jumpsquat) and makes it less reliable for punishing as such. Her up smash acts as a decent out of shield option as its first hit has decent horizontal range but is still frame 10, which while fast for an up smash, is only average startup for an out of shield option. Her rather high short hop also causes her aerials to be unviable out of shield outside of forward aerial on certain characters, and her grab by default is very slow. As such, ZSS's out of shield game suffers immensely if the opponent spaces against her shield well.

Finally, while her grab game has some utility, it is still with flaws. As her throws only deal passable damage at best, while her up throw is her only KO throw, they are only generally used to deal damage if other close-range moves stale. Her grab in general is also very laggy in startup and end lag, meaning that despite its long range, it is easy to punish from any sufficiently fast attack if it misses. Lastly, the nerfs to her down throw, which was easily her best throw from Smash 4, make her grab game more suited for direct offense instead of damage racking strings, giving it limited utility overall.

In the end, Zero Suit Samus retains much of her playstyle from Smash 4, being a hit-and-run character with a strong punishment game, while the transition from Smash 4 to Ultimate has improved her overall mobility and combo tools at the cost of KO power.</p>
