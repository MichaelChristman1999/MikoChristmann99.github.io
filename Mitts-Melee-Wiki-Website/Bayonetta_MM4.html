<h1>Bayonetta</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Bayonetta is a tall yet light character. She has a below average walking and air speed, average traction and dashing speed (with a decently fast initial dash), very fast air acceleration and fall speed, high gravity, and very high jumps. This gives her poor endurance, especially vertically, and average mobility.

Bayonetta's biggest strengths are her strong combo game - with her tilt attacks, forward aerial and special moves being capable of starting or extending combos - and her excellent recovery, which allows her to reach the stage from the bottom blast zone almost uncontestably. Her damage output is somewhat low in isolation, but her extensive combo game makes up for this, as her combos can quickly and easily rack up damage. She has a number of unique attributes, such as her Bullet Arts, which allow her to shoot from the guns on her hands and heels by keeping the button pressed down after an attack. They are a solid pressure tool, and because they are programmed as disjointed hitboxes, they are not classified as projectiles. She can also wall cling and wall jump.

Bayonetta's ground game is reliant on her tilt attacks to help set up intricate combos. Her jab is slow, but her rapid jab finisher can KO at high percentages. Her dash attack is also slow as it has a lot of startup lag, but it can also be a situational KO move. Both her up tilt and her down tilt have small hitboxes, but they are very good combo tools - up tilt is useful for getting her opponents into the air and also combos from her Heel Slide or into her Witch Twist, while her down tilt is a good out-of-shield option and has combo potential. Her forward tilt is her least useful tilt as it lacks follow-up options, though it forms a three-hit combo of its own if repeatedly pressed.

She has very useful special moves. Bullet Climax fires projectiles and is useful for KOing higher-percentage opponents at the left and right blast lines. Both Heel Slide and After Burner Kick are reliable combo starters, while the latter is also a good combo extender and horizontal recovery option. Witch Twist is a great tool for extending combos and dragging the opponent to the upper blast line. Though it has little vertical distance, it can be performed twice with Bayonetta's double jump, and she can also jump cancel her second jump to grant her extra vertical distance, giving her good horizontal recovery. Her Witch Time has a short duration and high ending lag, but it slows down time for a brief period if it activates. If Bayonetta gets hit in a specific time frame when dodging or in the later frames of Witch Time, she will activate her Bat Within. This turns her into bats and moves her to a (usually) more favorable stage position, and she will take half of the attack's damage output and no knockback.

Bayonetta's air game is similarly potent for combos, with her flexible recovery allowing her to use aerial combos far offstage. Her neutral aerial has great range (especially with the Bullet Arts, which covers a huge area around her) and can be a KO option at very high percentages. Back aerial is one of her strongest KO options because of its sweetspot and is a good combo finisher, though it is one of the slower back aerials in the game. Her forward aerial can edgeguard and, like her forward tilt, forms a three-hit combo of its own if pressed repeatedly. Her up aerial is fast and serves as a useful juggling tool, though it has very low knockback. Her down aerial is a stall-then-fall move which is a risky landing option due to its high ending lag, though it has a strong landing hit which can be a useful KO option. Her air game also has some utility in disadvantage state, with Downward After Burner Kick serving as a movement mix-up that can help her get back to the ground faster, while Bat Within serves as a potential combo breaker in certain situations.

Her grab and throw game has some utility, though to a lesser extent than the rest of her moveset. While up throw and down throw lack true follow-up potential outside of reads and mix-ups, the latter serves as a KO option at very high percentages. Additionally, while forward throw and back throw are purely positional throws, the former is her strongest kill throw, though its kill potential can easily be mitigated with proper DI.

Bayonetta's smash attacks allow her to summon Madama Butterfly's limbs. They each have good knockback and range, but they also have low priority and noticeable lag, meaning that attempting to use one (even in Witch Time) can cause them to clank with other moves and lead her to get punished. Her forward smash is her earliest KO option and one of her only attacks that can reliably kill before 100%, though it has a blind spot directly in front of Bayonetta. Her up smash covers the area directly in front of her and can KO from the upper blast line. Her down smash covers the same range as her up smash and is mainly useful for meteor smashing her opponents from the ledge, though it can also kill from the upper blast line at higher percentages.

Bayonetta has very noticeable flaws. Most notably, while she can quickly rack up damage with her combo game, she has very few reliable KO options until around 150%, with her only real kill options before this being her smash attacks, back air, and down air. Even then, these options are relatively mediocre; Bayonetta's smash attacks are slow, often get cancelled out by other moves and have spots with no hitbox; her back air has slow start-up at frame 11 and a relatively small sweetspot hitbox; and her down air is a laggy move that only KOs if it hits the opponent with certain hitboxes or while they're grounded. Even at percentages higher than 150%, her KO options are unreliable, extremely punishable if whiffed or only KO at very high percentages, for example her forward throw and dash attack. Bayonetta's combos themselves, while arguably her strongest asset, are also risky - they are still ineffective against good SDI. Additionally, Bayonetta suffers from having potentially some of the highest landing lag in the game, as her landing lag increases based on how many specials she has used in the air. As a result, she can be immobile upon landing for up to 50 frames. Though she has ways to get around this - for example, using Witch Time to cancel her landing lag or landing with an aerial can force the opponent away - these are ultimately situational, and a whiffed combo can lead to a big punish.

Furthermore, Bayonetta has poor frame data on the ground, with all of her standard grounded moves coming out at frame 7 or slower while also being unsafe on shield. This makes Bayonetta's approach among the worst in the entire cast, effectively forcing her to play a very defensive, bait-and-punish style which the opponent can counter by simply shielding or not approaching her. In addition, the fact that Bayonetta is a tall character with a fast fall speed and light weight means she is more easily comboed and more susceptible to being KO'd. Though Bat Within can somewhat alleviate the former problem, the issues compound to give her poor survivability.

Her passive abilities also have issues. While Bat Within has utility in the context of on-stage disadvantage, it is essentially a worse spot dodge on the ground, as Bayonetta will still take half of the dodged attack's damage if it is triggered. In the air, Bat Within has other issues - the fact that it only sends her down when triggered in the air means that it can cause SDs while she is offstage, and to balance the fact that Bat Within is so fast, the distance Bayonetta covers when actually air dodging is minimal.

Overall, Bayonetta is seen as a character with a high skill cap because of her extensive and complex combo game, her high-risk playstyle, and her unique abilities and techniques. She is a flexible, combo-oriented character who is good at quickly racking up damage and applying pressure to opponents, but her lack of reliable KO options means she can struggle in securing the stock (an issue which is exacerbated by her being prone to combos and kill setups herself). Due to her significantly steeper learning curve for (what most players consider) a relatively low reward, her playerbase is much weaker than it was in Smash 4. However, some players have achieved noteworthy results with her</p>
