<h1>Yoshi</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Yoshi is a heavyweight fighter with above-average mobility, good frame data, and decent KO potential. He sports a unique shield in the form of a Yoshi Egg, which covers his whole body no matter the damage it has taken; thus, it makes Yoshi immune to shield stabbing.

As stated previously, Yoshi sports excellent mobility: he has the 27th fastest walking speed, the 19th fastest dashing speed (with an above average initial dash as well), the single fastest air speed in the game, and the 14th highest air acceleration. Additionally, Yoshi sports among the highest jumping prowesses in the game; this can especially be owed to his double jump, which is the second highest in the game, only behind Mewtwo's. However, his traction and gravity are the 23rd and 20th lowest in the game respectively; further compounding this, his falling and fast-falling speeds are among the bottom 10 in the game (the 7th slowest to be specific). Thus, Yoshi is quite speedy overall, yet at the same time he's one of the floatiest characters in the game, which is incredibly unorthodox for a heavyweight, arguably moreso than any other in the game.

Complementing his high mobility, Yoshi's moveset possesses very good utility. Both hits of neutral attack can connect into each other, and the first hit can also be used to jab lock; forward tilt serves as a reliable combo starter at low-mid percents, due to its moderate base knockback and vertical launch angle; up tilt is an effective combo starter with low knockback growth, and leads to KO confirms at higher percents; and down tilt is his fastest tilt, sporting good range and serving as a reliable tech chasing option. Lastly, dash attack has a long duration and good range; this, combined with its decent knockback, makes it good for KOing opponents at later percents and punishing rolls or techs. Yoshi's smash attacks are also useful in their own right: forward smash has a powerful sweetspot that out prioritizes its slightly weaker sourspot, allowing it to KO at reasonable percents. It also has decent start-up, can be angled, and grants Yoshi intangibility for its duration; up smash has good horizontal and vertical range, reasonable start-up, and a powerful sweetspot, allowing it to KO at percents as low as 120% provided the sweetspot hits; lastly, down smash is extremely quick in both start-up and ending lag which, coupled with its good range, makes it an adept option for punishing rolling opponents.

Although his grounded moveset comes with potent attacks, it is Yoshi's aerial attacks that possess high usefulness and make up his fantastic air game. Neutral aerial is a very fast sex kick with low all-around lag, decent range, and good power, allowing it to either KO at surprisingly early percents, serve as an effective combo breaker, be a tech-chase set-up, and be his primary out of shield option. Forward aerial also possesses high range and reasonable all-around lag, and comes with impressive damage; its tipper hitbox meteor smashes opponents, allowing for offstage KOs to occur as early as 20%. Back aerial boasts high speed and high power, with its first two hits being effective combo starters and its final hit KOing below 130%. Up aerial possesses high vertical range and a hitbox that hits behind the opponent which, in tandem with its impressive damage output and low all-around lag, makes it an effective juggling option. Lastly, down aerial serves as the most damaging aerial in the game; its hits can easily link into each other, with its high vertical knockback allows it to KO at reasonable percentages near the upper blast zone. His grab game is also relatively decent: his grab release and throws grant invincibility during their animations, pummel is fast and deals average damage, forward and back throws are decent KO options by the ledge, up throw has combo potential into his up air at low percents, and down throw has little ending lag making it his most useful combo throw.

Yoshi's special moves are also very effective tools for the character. Egg Lay is a command grab which traps the opponent in an egg for a short amount of time, allowing it to work as a damage racker, and when B-reversed is an effective surprise trapping option. Egg Roll travels decently fast on the ground and deals effective damage when running into an opponent, Yoshi Bomb gives Yoshi an option to escape juggles if the situation allows for it, can go through soft platforms, does high damage in both the ground and air, and the grounded version deals high shield damage. However, his best special move is easily his Egg Throw, his only but incredibly effective projectile. The trajectory of the move can be changed depending on the angle of the joystick, can bounce on the ground, and allows Yoshi to have an option for zoning.

Although Yoshi's strengths allow him to be effective in many instances, he has some noticeable weaknesses; the main problem being that his recovery is very limited. His double jump and air speed make getting back onstage with him more plausible, but his double jump can only be used once and if his opponent has a move that breaks his armor limit, then he'll likely be in a difficult situation for getting back onstage. His other recovery options outside of his double jump are very short-ranged and punishable, with Egg Throw only giving vertical distance upon its first three usages and directional air dodges having high ending lag. His reliance on his double jump to recover also impacts his disadvantage state - unlike most other fighters, who can use their midair jump to escape unfavorable positions when landing, the height it grants Yoshi can simply keep him landing for longer, and if he is knocked offstage after using it, then much of his recovery is limited. Because of this, Yoshi players must be especially careful in juggling scenarios, which can be exploited.

His approach can also be very punishable as his moves outside of tilts are noticeably slower, with every one of his aerial attacks outside of his neutral and up aerials having below-average speed, and most of his attacks have short-range that leaves him vulnerable to getting stuffed out by disjointed hitboxes. His grab is also very punishable when missed despite its invincibility and long-range, Egg Lay is very limited and has no usage if the opponent is far away, Egg Roll has a very predictable trajectory and is hard for Yoshi to get out of if the attack doesn't work well in his current situation, and Yoshi Bomb is also predictable if used unsafely and has high ending lag when Yoshi hits the ground. Finally, his shield, as useful as it is due to never shrinking when weakened, presents a double-edged sword situation: a weakened shield can still be hit easily, and as such can break more easily than a normal shield.

Overall, Yoshi is still a strong character despite his glaring weaknesses. With his fast speed and reliable attacks, he has the ability to combo, take out stocks, and play an effective neutral game. His tournament results have been very strong because of these attributes, with players such as Suarez, Ron, and Meme showing the potential that he has. Some players even consider him to be better than he was in Smash 64, although the latter is debatable.</p>
