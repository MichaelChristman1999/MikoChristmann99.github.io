<h1>Terry Bogard</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Terry is a tall, heavyweight fighter who weighs the same as Samus, Dark Samus, and Bowser Jr. Due to hailing from a traditional fighting game series, Terry always faces his opponent in 1-on-1 matches, a trait that he shares with Ryu, Ken, and Kazuya. While this makes it more difficult for him to utilize his powerful back aerial, it more importantly makes his command inputs easier to execute and less likely to misinput, and allows him to punish rolls and cross ups more easily than the vast majority of the cast. He has slow air speed, a very slow initial dash, and decent dashing speed, but is characterized most by his great ground game. This includes a potent backward dash (which allows Terry to play footsies very effectively), a strong set of normal moves and special moves, his unique ability to attack directly out of a spot dodge, and his comeback mechanic which allows incredibly powerful Super Special Moves that require specific input combinations to use.

Terry's playstyle capitalizes on his strong bait-and-punish options. Terry has good tools, sporting many finishing moves in his smash attacks, clean dash attack, clean back aerial, sweetspotted down aerial, and the majority of his special moves. Forward tilt sports good range and above-average damage, while also granting Terry's leg intangibility. Dash attack has respectable power and traveling distance, the latter of which extends to its ability to cross up shields. Forward smash deals very high damage and knockback with impressive horizontal range to boot. Up smash has good vertical range and also deals high damage and knockback. Down smash has good range and high speed, but is still decently strong. Back aerial deals high damage and knockback when clean, and sports excellent range overall. Lastly, down aerial is Terry's most damaging aerial, and can meteor smash opponents when sweetspotted.

Like Ryu, Ken, and Kazuya, Terry's special moves have special inputs that grant them more power and capabilities. These are generally dictated by how long the player holds the special button and normally determine distance and strength. His neutral special, Power Wave, is a projectile that travels on ground and serves as a good long-range poke that has both a weak and strong version, with the latter having a faster travel distance. In mid-air, it instead turns into a mid-range poking tool that deals more knockback, while also temporarily suspending Terry in the air. All of Terry's other moves come in four different variations when accounting for their weak/strong regular input variations and their weak/strong command input variations. Burning Knuckle (↓ ↘ → + attack/special) is one of Terry's go-to KO options, as even the weak regular input can KO opponents at reasonable percents. In addition to its KO potential, it is Terry's best tech-chasing tool. Terry is also the first character to sport a "backward special" in the form of Crack Shoot (↓ ↙ ← + attack/special). While it is not a KO move, it high-profiles through certain low attacks and has a wide enough hitbox that it serves as both a reliable anti-air and Terry's most reliable cross up option at point-blank range. Rising Tackle (c.↓ ↑ + attack/special) sports intangibility on Terry's legs, and its command input version sports full body invincibility, making it an effective anti-air. Finally, Power Dunk (→ ↓ ↘ + attack/special) serves as a strong combo ender with invincibility on startup, and is another one of Terry's most reliable KO moves. The command version has a meteor hitbox, though connecting this hitbox is difficult, as it is only active during the descending portion.

One of Terry's biggest strengths is his punish game. Due to his ability to cancel some moves into specials, such as his jab, neutral aerial, and down aerial, Terry can successfully deal a large amount of damage from any opening, and due to his unique ability of always facing his opponent in 1v1 battles, this grants him very strong ledgetrapping potential. The aforementioned Power Dunk is among the most notable, as Terry can cancel into it from even his jab, and KO opponents with relative ease. Additionally, Terry has a comeback mechanic in the form of two Super Special Moves: Power Geyser (↓ ↙ ← ↙ → + attack/special or ↓ ← ↓ → + attack/special) and Buster Wolf (↓ ↘ → ↓ ↘ → + attack/special or ↓ → ↓ → + attack/special). Power Geyser is an enormous geyser of energy that is released from the ground directly in front of Terry. It boasts incredible height and damage; this not only makes it an excellent KO option, but also an extremely effective anti-air move, as well as a very potent threat to shields. Buster Wolf causes Terry to dash forward a fair distance (roughly half the length of Final Destination) in order to throw a punch that functions as a hit command grab, similarly to Fishing Rod. If the punch hits, he immediately generates an explosive, highly damaging blast of energy from his fist that can KO extremely early. As these moves are only accessible when Terry is at or above 100% in Stock or Time Battles (or his hit points are 30% or lower in Stamina Mode) their effective power is further increased slightly by rage. However, while Terry is able to use these attacks any amount of times when passed the percentage threshold, their considerable ending lag makes them very punishable if blocked or whiffed.

Although he is known for being a punishing character with a plethora of KO moves, set-ups, and confirms, Terry also has a good combo game. Neutral attack can easily chain into itself or special cancel to deal high amounts of damage. Up tilt boasts both high speed and damage, has good range, can be special canceled, and is reliable for juggles. Down tilt deals extremely low damage and knockback while having very low all-around lag, making it a fairly spammable poke and useful combo starter, even being able to set up into KO confirms. Neutral and up aerials both provide plentiful combo opportunities, due to their mixture of low overall lag, good range, and decent damage outputs and knockback. Despite his poor air speed, Terry's neutral aerial can combo into itself with ease, to the point that it can perform a Wall of Pain which can then be easily followed up with his down aerial's meteor smash hitbox.

In spite of his strengths, Terry still has notable drawbacks. His overall disadvantage state is a glaring weakness: Terry's fall speed is among the lower half of the cast, and when combined with his tall hurtbox, he is noticeably susceptible to juggles. Rising Tackle, while having intangibility throughout the first half of the move, is unable to sweetspot the edge, meaning that Terry is forced to utilize it from very low under the stage, as he is otherwise left vulnerable for a hard punish at the move's apex. Additionally, the move's vertical and horizontal distance is sub-par, making it a generally inferior recovery move. Terry's aerial speed is also well below-average, making his off-stage endurance lacking. While he is able to mix up his recovery to a certain extent with his specials, he is unlikely to survive in most off-stage situations if he has exhausted his double jump and side special.

Despite having a strong grounded neutral game, it is largely centered around baiting the opponent to approach and reading their habits to lead into combo extensions. As such, Terry doesn't possess many good pokes outside of down tilt. Given his average ground speed and poor air speed, Terry's aerial approaches are fairly weak unless he starts close to his target. Though Terry's inputs are a bit more lenient in comparison to the other traditional fighting game characters, it can nonetheless take time to master his inputs to their full potential, giving him a relatively high learning curve overall. The Super Special Moves are of particular note: they are accessible only when his damage is at 100% or his hit points are 30% or lower in Stamina Mode, and they both have considerable ending lag to compensate for their astounding power. As a result, Terry's playstyle can change drastically when the Super Specials comes into play. Improper inputs can also result in failing to perform what would otherwise be a KO confirm (such as with Power Dunk), or even an unintentional self-destruct (such as with Burning Knuckle/Crack Shoot). As such, it is crucial to get the hang of inputting moves correctly and at the right time in order to avoid inadvertently putting Terry in a very disadvantageous situation.

Overall, Terry is a melee-focused and "footsies"-oriented heavyweight character with immense combo, damage, and KO options in all areas. His ability to apply dangerous shield pressure or cross-up shielding opponents is incredibly useful when executed at the right times. The Super Special Moves can also give Terry the mental edge over opponents, as any ill-managed approach on the opponent's end can be called out by extremely hard punishes. Due to being a heavyweight he is very hard to KO without a proper edge-guard, making him more dangerous the longer he holds onto his stock. However, his poor disadvantage state and mediocre off-stage endurance means players need to be mindful of every off-stage option, as Terry can be KO'd easily to an off-stage gimp, and despite his powerful neutral, many of his most effective moves leave him vulnerable, meaning the player must make calculated decisions with which attacks to throw out in pressure situations. While his strengths currently seem to outweigh his weaknesses, his competitive viability has yet to be determined, as he was only available for four months prior to the closure of most tournaments worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
