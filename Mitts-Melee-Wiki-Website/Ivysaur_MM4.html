<h1>Ivysaur</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Ivysaur is one of the characters made playable from Pokémon Trainer, alongside the likes of Squirtle and Charizard. It is a middleweight fighter, having a below average dash and gravity, an average jump height, and high traction. While Squirtle will automatically be the first Pokémon on-screen if Pokémon Trainer is selected, pressing the Y button on the character select screen will toggle Ivysaur as first. In relation to Pokémon change, the order is always Ivysaur-Charizard-Squirtle. If Squirtle is KOd, Ivysaur will always appear on the next revival platform.

One of Ivysaur's biggest strengths is its range, as its vine-based attacks (neutral attack, up tilt, down tilt, down smash, forward aerial, back aerial, and Vine Whip) all have very generous range that allow Ivysaur to keep foes at a distance with relative ease. Among said attacks, they all either synergize as get-off-me options (down tilt/down smash), mix-up options (up tilt/neutral aerial) or niche KO moves (forward aerial and Vine Whip), which grant Ivysaur a decently effective ranged toolkit. Altogether, this mix gives Ivysaur among the most effective range in the game, made more effective by said moves all having at most 15 frames of startup.

Another strength that Ivysaur has is its strong air game. While its back aerial is among the weakest of aerial attacks in the game, its aforementioned range allows it to keep foes at a distance. Its neutral aerial has use as a combo extender due to its looping hits using the autolink angle, although its low power makes it easy to intercept. Its up and down aerials are notorious for their KO power and large hitboxes, while its forward aerial, despite its slow startup, is a reliable combo starter into Vine Whip due to its diagonal knockback. Additionally, none of its aerial attacks have more than 17 frames of landing lag, making them good for air-to-ground approaches.

Ivysaur's grab game is also useful. While all of its grabs are active on frame 13, they are among the longest-reaching in Ultimate and are decently fast overall, which further adds to Ivysaur's already strong range. To boot, all of its throws deal at least 7% damage. While its forward throw is ironically unsuitable for both combos and KOs due to its high base knockback and low knockback growth, its back throw is a good KO option at the edge, and its up throw is a decent low-percentage combo tool. However, of particular note is its down throw: despite its low damage, its has strong combo potential until around 100%, while its knockback scaling also makes it the strongest down throw in the game, allowing it to KO in situations where back throw cannot.

Finally, Ivysaur has a useful array of special moves. Bullet Seed is a fast, multi-hitting attack that hits foes directly above Ivysaur with decent damage, allowing it to work well as an anti-air. Razor Leaf is a projectile that despite its slow startup, lingers for a short time and has low knockback, allowing it to be used effectively for stage control and combo setups. Lastly, Vine Whip is Ivysaur's primary recovery move and a strong KO option when sweetspotted, and like other tethers in Ultimate, has a very long range.

However, Ivysaur is held back by various flaws. Perhaps Ivysaur's most prominent issue is its ground game: while its tilt attacks have strong range, they are also equally lacking in power, while its smash attacks are generally predictable due to slow startup. Its up smash is among the strongest in the game, but it has very slow startup at 26 frames, while its horizontal range renders it hard to approach with against grounded opponents. Its dash attack is a good burst option, but also suffers from low knockback scaling and cannot KO reliably. Finally, due to said problems, Ivysaur is very susceptible to stale-move negation, meaning it will almost constantly rely on its ranged attacks, all of which deal low damage.

Ivysaur also has a problematic recovery. While its up and down aerials provide different vertical movement options, they are only useful when close to the stage due to their ending lag. Vine Whip has long range as a tether, but only works if Ivysaur is sufficiently close to a ledge, where it is susceptible to stage spikes. Altogether, this makes it infeasible for Ivysaur to recover when above the stage, where any sufficiently strong semi-spike or meteor smash can potentially keep it away from ledges.

Altogether, Ivysaur fills the "zoner" role for Pokemon Trainer's lineup, with its long range, disjointed attacks, and projectile allowing it to excel at keeping opponents out. It is the middle of the three in weight, and is usually used around mid-high percent because of its strong advantage state, combos, and zoning ability.</p>
