<h1>Ridley</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Ridley is a heavyweight character and the tallest fighter in the game, tied for the 12th heaviest character, and possesses the third lowest traction. Ridley has overall good mobility, especially compared to most of his fellow heavyweights: with two midair jumps, slightly above average walk speed, tied with Charizard for the 10th fastest dashing speed, average air speed, air acceleration and gravity, and the 17th fastest falling speed. Ridley also boasts a faster frame data than most heavyweights, further setting him apart from them.

Ridley's most defining trait is his potent and varied punish game and aerial pressure. With remarkably long range, high power and decent speed throughout his moveset, as well as a projectile, Ridley is a serious threat once he gets the advantage; with opponents often overwhelmed and/or find it difficult to get in. His key strength is his strong air game. Boasting overall quick, powerful, long-ranged aerials, and decent air mobility give Ridley overall excellent air pressure potential. Thanks to his additional jump and relatively high fast fall speed, he has superb vertical flexibility, and can use additional jumps or surprise fastfalls to fake out and punish his opponents with his far-reaching aerials. His neutral aerial is arguably his most effective aerial, due to having low all-around lag, good range, and average knockback. It is a good comboing, spacing, and edge-guarding tool, while also being fast enough to break out opposing pressure if positioned correctly; these traits make it among the best of its kind and one of Ridley's most commonly used moves. Forward aerial, while having merely average power, has the highest damage output of Ridley's aerials when all hits are sweetspotted, and is infamous for being able to perform a wall of pain at low percentages, especially due to Ridley's aforementioned two midair jumps. Back aerial is decently quick, long-ranged and has consistently high damage and knockback, which makes it a deadly KO move, especially if used off-stage for edge-guarding. Up aerial is a good, disjointed juggling move with decent startup and good KO potential when sweetspotted, but requires opponents to be very close to or above Ridley to land. Lastly, down aerial is a stall-and-fall that powerfully meteor smashes opponents when sweetspotted, and can potentially be recovered from if initiated slightly above the ground. Even when sourspotted, it has high KO potential, similar to Bowser's own down aerial.

Ridley also has an abundance of powerful moves like his fellow heavyweights, with his tail-based moves having higher power if sweetspotted with the bladed end of his tail. His power also leads into one of his other primary strengths: his edge-guarding ability. His powerful air game gives him the innate ability to edge-guard offstage effectively, as many of his attacks have great KO or gimping potential, while his long-distanced recovery makes coming back to the stage a non-issue. His neutral aerial has decent range and is powerful when sweetspotted at the tip. Forward aerial boasts great wall of pain potential with enough reach and a long enough duration to effectively gimp most recovering opponents. Finally, as mentioned before, his back aerial has the strongest and most consistent knockback of his aerials. Ridley also has easy ways to set up edge-guards; his down tilt and down throw are both reliable combo starters that launch at favorable angles, and he has plenty of other attacks that deal high horizontal knockback, such as forward tilt and dash attack.

Ridley's grounded game is also noteworthy in terms of utility. His neutral attack is his fastest attack, and has both great damage potential thanks to its infinite, and surprising power due to the regular third hit. His forward tilt has good range and low lag overall, while dealing high knockback if the tip connects, with the low aim version being a reliable two-framing option. Meanwhile, his up and down tilts offer varied potential, with up tilt being a great anti-air that chains into itself, most aerials, and even up smash, whereas down tilt allows Ridley to combo off from a safe distance and position the opponent into very vulnerable spots ripe for punishing or juggling. His dash attack is one of the few to have no sourspots throughout, and has respectable power. Forward smash has below-average startup (around the same as Mr. Game & Watch and Palutena) and is short ranged, but is one of the strongest of its kind in both damage and knockback, and is just fast enough to two frame and punish whiffs, landings, or be a more situational follow up, like off a late hit of a landing neutral aerial, or a frame tight execution after a gentleman jab. Down smash has slow start up and less raw power, but has very large, mostly disjointed range as it makes use of the invulnerable parts of Ridley's wings, along with totally lacking a sourspot. It also has the added trait of Ridley hopping high during the start-up; this can allow Ridley to completely dodge attacks, even sometimes those with center aim, making it especially effective in fields like punishing a get up attack or punishing grab whiffs. It is also a notoriously effective punishment option after a successful Skewer sweetspot, as the short hop itself can cover most get-up options. This more commonly is used to cover ledge get-up options from the opponent, as with proper timing, Down Smash can cover almost the entire cast's options to return to stage, only being checked by moves that can hit from below stage (like Ridley's own uair). Finally, up smash is Ridley's fastest and most reliable smash attack; while not having the sheer power of the other two, it is still powerful in its own right, and is also a very effective anti-air as it makes Ridley's foot invulnerable. Overall, each of Ridley's grounded moves have different attributes that make them useful, while still giving him the typical great power of a heavyweight.

Additionally, his special moveset offers interesting options. Plasma Breath is Ridley's projectile; it fires a small, bouncing ball of fire, and can be charged to fire from two to five; when fully charged, it can deal substantial damage if it hits with every projectile. These traits make it a useful damage-racking, combo-starting, and on-stage edgeguarding and gimping tool. However, the move also possesses a hurtbox on Ridley's mouth that damages and stuns him if he is hit there, and while sometimes the recoil can serve as a niche defensive option due to Ridley not suffering any knockback from it, especially when offstage, this is still very risky. Skewer is a "high risk, high reward" punishment move that, when sweetspotted, deals extremely high damage and crumples enemies; while situational due to the high difficulty on sweetspotting the move, it puts the opponent in a dangerous position where Ridley can read their reaction. Space Pirate Rush is a command grab with some unique perks; it can be cancelled into a throw at any time that puts both Ridley and the opponent into the air. On land, Ridley drags the opponent on the ground, dealing high damage when performed from one ledge to another, and launching opponents offstage when Ridley reaches the edge of a floor, with the launch being capable of KOing at high percentages. In the air, it makes Ridley drop down to the floor until he lands, which can allow for easy gimps offstage as Ridley can drag opponents closer to a blast zone, potentially leaving them too far to recover. Lastly, Wing Blitz is Ridley's primary recovery move. It can be aimed in four directions, with the forward input traveling at a slight downwards angle, the backward variant traveling at a slight upward one, and the down variant traveling at a slight diagonal angle in front of Ridley. All Wing Blitz variants have a large ledge sweetspot and have high knockback, with the down input meteor smashing opponents; the down input is also unique in that it can be used at the edge of the stage and grab the ledge as long as the down direction is not inputted for longer, which can let Ridley potentially ledge trump an unsuspecting opponent or send them straight down, depending on their position.

Another notable aspect of Ridley's kit is his impressive, long-distanced recovery. As a multi-jumper with decent air speed, air acceleration and gravity, Ridley can naturally reposition himself to adapt to the situation. Space Pirate Rush can offer Ridley some horizontal gain, as well as threaten the opponent with a moving command grab that can put them in a very uncomfortable position, and has the benefit of not leaving Ridley helpless. Wing Blitz, however, provides a lot of unique properties. The intangible tips can prevent many attacks with the right aim, including but not limited to Villager's forward smash, Ness's down smash charge, and Mega Man's down aerial. Due to the "bounce" that occurs when Wing Blitz hits the side of a stage, Ridley can even recover while avoiding counter moves, a trait that very few recoveries have. The attack itself is also quite strong, giving it impressive guard-breaking potential, and covers a long distance relatively quickly, with the startup time being mitigated by how far Ridley can recover from. This can discourage the opponent from trying to edge-guard Ridley at all, especially if he has his extra jump in reserve, and can make Ridley surprisingly difficult to edge guard if he's in position. Lastly, his aerial moves can mitigate some of the vulnerability in his recovery due to their low lag. All in all, despite being rigid and potentially exploitable, Ridley's recovery has attributes and options that are both unique and valuable for any character, especially a heavyweight.

Ridley's large frame also gives him remarkable range. Many of Ridley's moves have large, disjointed hitboxes, some even eclipsing sword users like Marth and Ike. Ridley's disjoints can even challenge and beat out incoming projectiles when timed right, and can even sometimes break him out of disadvantage. This is all on top of the aforementioned projectile he has. Finally, and thanks to his range, Ridley possesses a surprisingly dangerous combo game. His down throw, up tilt, down tilt, neutral aerial, and Plasma Breath can lead into various strings and combos that can rack up huge damage with only a few hits, with some even leading to kill confirms (such as Plasma Breath to dash attack, late hit neutral aerial to forward smash, and up tilt into back or up aerial). Combined with the aforementioned power and utility on his moves, this allows Ridley to pile up damage as quickly as his fellow heavyweights, and also makes it risky for opponents to regain the advantage, as Ridley's ability to start combos and break a defense even while in a disadvantage forces the opponent to be cautious of Ridley's options. All of Ridley's traits make him a strangely varied fighter for his weight and size, allowing him to play differently depending on the situation.

While it's an understated attribute, Ridley's jack-of-all-trades archetype allows Ridley to have a valuable tool or playstyle in almost all match ups, which plays very well to Ridley's strengths. Ridley's disjointed range is effective against characters with poor range or grab-centric playstyles, his command grab is effective against characters that are highly defensive or have difficulty recovering, and his projectile is effective against characters that lack their own projectile or an effective method of dealing with them. Ridley's surprising defensive capabilities are most notable in matches that would seemingly favor the aggressor, such as his rather impressively low ledge hang (which can even evade moves like Marth and Lucina's forward smash), the surprisingly low profile of his crouch, and the previously mentioned intangible tips of his Wing Blitz recovery. In the end, while many characters can give Ridley trouble, few characters are equipped to successfully negate his tools, and even fewer are able to negate all of them.

While Ridley has amazing strengths, he also has some critical and easy-to-exploit weaknesses. The most notable of them is his size; Ridley has among the largest, most awkward hurtboxes out of the cast, which combined with his heavy weight and fast falling speed makes him very easy to combo, juggle, and hit in general. On top of that, his lower weight compared to characters of a similar size also negatively affects his survivability, as he is often at a considerably higher risk of dying much earlier from being in disadvantage than other heavy characters due his mixture of very large size and only moderately heavy weight. While Ridley's frame data is rather poor, although good for a heavyweight, he has below average startup and above average ending lag overall on his toolkit, so he lacks a tool fast enough to break combos effectively; this makes him one of the most affected characters by average combo strings, and he is rather easy to KO. Ridley’s options against projectile users and zoning are virtually nonexistent despite having a projectile himself; Plasma Breath is laggy, its projectiles travel slowly, and are useless against more powerful projectiles, and the move's recoil property on Ridley's mouth can easily open up opportunities for more attacks against him that would end a stock, even if said recoil would help prevent knockback in emergency situations, such as being at KO percent. Ridley's disjointed moves are seldom capable of beating out projectiles, and he has few moves that boast enough range to challenge zoners, and these options usually require a great deal of effort to execute right compared to what they're challenging, which can quickly lead to Ridley being cornered into a worse situation. All of this is further worsened with how tricky it can be to land with Ridley, despite him being a fast-faller.

Adding to the above is Ridley's recovery, which is still exploitable despite its long distance. Both of his recovery specials, Space Pirate Rush and Wing Blitz, have high startup and the latter, despite its appearance and its impressive distance, has only four angled travel routes, which means that Ridley has to properly get into a good position to recover, giving the opponent more than enough time to react. While Wing Blitz has some minor defenses while active, that being invulnerability on the spiked tips of his wings along with dealing heavy knockback on contact, it does not have a charging hitbox while his body remains vulnerable throughout the move, so it can be quite easy to aim for with prediction. This is worse when a character has a counterattack or heavily disjointed attacks, as they can safely challenge the move at any stage of its animation, though certain stages can allow Ridley to evade being countered by aiming Wing Blitz toward the stage and bouncing up to the ledge from impact. Without his midair jumps, Ridley can also have a lot of trouble recovering from below, and any low-sending attack like a semi-spike can put Ridley into an unrecoverable position. Because of this, offstage Ridley usually is forced to use his extra jumps as emergency jumps when he's in a disadvantage, which while valuable, is noticeably less useful than most other multi-jumpers. As a result, Ridley's overall endurance is poor for a large heavyweight, and while his survivability isn't as poor as other lighter characters, it is unimpressive for a heavyweight and for his size.

Another critical flaw to Ridley is how drastically his moves vary in quality, which can lead to Ridley becoming quite predictable. While he has plenty of moves offering varying amounts of utility, some of them still have significant flaws; these can range from slow startup (Plasma Breath and down smash), absurd blindspots (up tilt and sometimes up smash), overly situational and/or strict (Skewer), to being downright unreliable (down aerial). On the other side of the spectrum, some of Ridley's moves like neutral aerial, up smash, down tilt, and depending on the match-up, the aforementioned Plasma Breath is so favorable that it becomes easy to over-centralize on their use. Ridley is a character that finds the most success in being unpredictable, which can be difficult when a player subconsciously checks off using so many moves. This, combined with his aforementioned trouble at dealing with fast and/or zoning characters, and with recovering under pressure, makes Ridley one of the most susceptible characters to pressure, as Ridley's disadvantage state makes him easy to overwhelm, and failure to overwhelm or control aggression could force him to take heavy damage or even be KOed outright.

A notable downside of Ridley's kit is his mediocre grab game. All variations of his grab possess mediocre to poor frame data and small range for his stature, making him easily punishable should Ridley whiff a grab. While down throw functions as a strong and reliable combo tool from low to mid percentages, and is even capable of KOing at very high percentages (around 150% on middleweights), none of Ridley's other throws provide much usage beyond repositioning the opponent. Forward and back throw lack reasonable kill power, even with ideal positioning, and up throw, while being his most damaging throw and a passable kill throw with low ceiling stages, sends opponents too high for any true conversions, instead setting them up for juggles. DI can also influence Ridley’s follow-up options off down throw, limiting his options should the opponent choose to DI away. While the existence of Space Pirate Rush somewhat mitigates his lack of a strong throw due to its ability to KO at the ledge at high percentages, overall, Ridley's grab game is almost entirely centralized by his down throw's utility, with his other throws being situational at best.

Lastly, while Ridley's advantage state is unarguably very oppressive, one key attribute holding this back is his middling airspeed. For his additional mid-air jump and impressive aerials, their full potential is greatly held back by Ridley's surprising difficulty in staying airborne. He generally needs to gain some distance while grounded to approach with his aerials, and while his dash speed is very impressive, it's restrictive regardless, and Ridley lacks the number of jumps that characters like King Dedede and Pit have to help circumvent their airspeed issues. Various combos usually are unable to extend in the air for long thanks to this, as his aerials may deal too much knockback to follow up after one or two attacks. This is further shown in his recovery, as Wing Blitz and Space Pirate Rush are usually options he must use to recover, even if Ridley isn't that far from the stage. While Ridley's airspeed is definitely better than most other fellow characters with multiple jumps, it's still merely average compared to the whole cast, which tones down his overall effectiveness in the air, and this is further exacerbated by him being a fast-faller.

Overall, Ridley is a character of extremes, with a relatively high learning curve and an even higher cerebral curve. Similarly to what Mewtwo is among its fellow lightweight characters, Ridley fills in the position of being a glass cannon among his fellow heavyweights. He has excellent damage, pressure, and edge-guarding potential with a broad arsenal of powerful moves and tools to gain and sustain advantage, gradually poke and pressure from a fair distance away, and punish whiffs or what would normally be an inconsequential slip-up. This allows Ridley to easily make comebacks or greatly widen his lead with minimal set up should an opponent make a single error in considering Ridley's approach. However, despite possessing a powerful and highly versatile moveset, Ridley lacks strong options out of disadvantage and generally struggles to oppose pressure from opponents due to his size and the frame data on his aerials and grounded attacks. This makes top tier matchups like Snake and Palutena difficult for Ridley, as they are well-equipped to combat Ridley through oppressive walls of projectiles or strong aerial combos respectively. As such, mix-up heavy playstyles are heavily encouraged when playing Ridley to prevent opponents from capitalising on his own susceptibility as much as possible.

Ridley's competitive potential is subject for debate, sometimes placed on the border between low and mid tier while sometimes being much lower or much higher. Some professional players consider him a low-tier due to his poor disadvantage state and difficulty surviving for heavyweight standards, while others like MkLeo and ESAM argue that he is a higher mid-tier thanks to his strong advantage state and wide array of options for multiple playstyles. This can be further expressed by his tournament presence; Ridley is an unpopular pick, yet displays respectable to impressive placings relative to his usage, with smashers like Nair^, Vreyvus, and Locus demonstrating his potential. Because of this, Ridley is considered a viable character, though the difficulty in learning his strengths for high level play and how punishable Ridley can be from human error make Ridley one of the more rarely seen viable characters. In casual fields, Ridley is notorious for how exploitable his weaknesses can be and the many pitfalls that beginners can fall into, especially with poor routing of Wing Blitz leading to awkward and anti-climactic finishes, proving his high learning curve for his size class.</p>
