<h1>Mii Brawler</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Being the "up close and personal" Mii Fighter, the Brawler now possesses a good walking/dashing speed (tied with Toon Link and Mewtwo for walk speed and the 25th fastest dash speed) and the ability to wall jump in exchange for now being a middleweight fighter (sharing the same weight as Inkling, Ness, and Lucas) with a fast falling speed, an above-average air speed, and an average air acceleration. As a Mii Fighter, their specials are determinant on the player's choice. Like the other two Mii Fighters, they have access to 12 different specials: Shot Put, Flashing Mach Punch, and Exploding Side Kick (Neutral Special), Onslaught, Burning Dropkick, and Suplex (Side Special), Soaring Axe Kick, Helicopter Kick, and Thrust Uppercut (Up Special), and Head-On Assault, Feint Jump, and Counter Throw (Down Special).

As with other Mii Fighters, one of the strengths of the Mii Brawler is their diverse set of special moves. Many of their specials help rack up damage, improve their recovery, or possess fantastic KO power. Shot Put is a fantastic tool for edgeguarding due to its arc and strong knockback. Moves such as Burning Dropkick and Feint Jump both aid the Brawler's recovery, providing decent horizontal distance. Suplex serves as a potent mindgame special, as well as an excellent way of racking up damage, dealing about 20% for each successful Suplex landed, even when stale.

Accompanying their varying specials, the Mii Brawler is a fairly nimble fighter with great combo potential. Their walking and dashing speed is above average and many of their normals have relatively low start-up and ending lag. All of their tilts and aerials (with the exception of down aerial) come out fairly quickly and are safe on shield when properly spaced or timed. Up tilt can lead to airdodge chases at very low percentages and chain into itself at low-mid percentages while down tilt can combo into forward aerial and neutral aerial at low percentages and other aerials/special moves at higher percentages. Neutral aerial is an excellent sex kick that boasts a wide range of utility due to its speed and extremely low landing lag, making it a very useful tool for edgeguarding, initiating, continuing, and breaking combos, and approaching. Forward tilt serves as a decent spacing tool due to it no longer having a sour spot and its ability to be angled while their down throw is a very good combo initiator, capable of comboing into a variety of moves. Dash attack comes out very quick and stays active for a long time while covering a large distance, making it extremely effective for whiff punishing or catching landing opponents. Additionally, Mii Brawler has a plethora of moves that have high KO potential. Forward smash deals extremely high knockback and can kill at low-mid percentages, and additionally be confirmed out of a landing neutral air at mid percentages. The initial hit of up smash is a potent finisher that has very low start-up. Many of their specials can secure early KOs as well, especially Thrust Uppercut and Helicopter Kick. Exploding Side Kick is as strong as Falcon Punch and is safe on shield, Head-On Assault, Suplex and Soaring Axe Kick can perform sacrificial KOs at low percentages (the first of which also breaking shields), and Counter Throw is among the strongest counters in the game.

In addition to their normals, All of Mii Brawler's throws except for back throw serve a purpose past positioning. Down throw is Brawler's strongest throw in most situations, as it confirms into almost any aerial until high percentages, at which point it can be used to confirm into Helicopter Kick or Thrust Uppercut. At extremely high percents (190%+) It will begin to KO opponents off the top of stages with lower ceiling blastzones. Forward throw also serves as a kill throw, capable of killing opponents at high yet reasonable percents near ledge, where they may be expecting another kill move like back aerial or up smash, adding to Mii Brawler's corner pressure. Lastly, while up throw does not kill or combo, it does the most damage of any of Mii Brawler's throws at 11% (13.8% in 1v1s), making it a useful tool for simultaneously dealing a large amount of damage and setting the opponent up for juggling.

Additionally, Mii Brawler has a plethora of excellent defensive tools. Neutral aerial serves as a quick out of shield option with its 6-frame start-up, factoring in the initial jump squat frames. Up Smash hits on frame 8 and has Mii Brawler's legs intangible for the first half of its active frames making it a great anti-air option. Finally, All of Mii Brawler's Up Specials also serve as great out of shield options with Soaring Axe Kick having excellent range to punish disjointed attacks and retreating aerials, Helicopter Kick coming out as fast as Up Smash while being reversable, and Thrust Uppercut being Mii Brawler's fastest OOS option at frame 3, allowing it act both as a punish to some of the game's safest moves and a pre-emptive anti-air against landing aerials and jumping opponents.

In terms of recovery, Mii Brawler has some good options. Soaring Axe Kick has great vertical distance but suffers horizontally. Burning Dropkick, Helicopter Kick and Feint Jump provide better horizontal recovery. Feint Jump, much like Zero Suit Samus' Flip Jump, is a good tool that can both mix up and extend Mii Brawler's otherwise lackluster recovery as well as aid in escaping juggles thanks to its frame 2 invincibility, a frame faster than their airdodge. However, if Mii Brawler is hit out of Feint Jump, they will be unable to use it again until they grab a ledge or land on stage. Burning Dropkick can be used multiple times and its decent travel distance can be further improved by B-reversing it in the air. Helicopter Kick travels at a low angle, giving it excellent horizontal recovery potential but weak vertical distance. Thrust Uppercut is a fast recovery option but is perhaps the most restrictive up special Mii Brawler has for recovery.

However, Mii Brawler does not come without their own flaws. In exchange for their decent mobility and speed, their fixed middleweight status doesn't grant them high survivability. This is further exacerbated by their fast falling speed and susceptibility to combos. Furthermore, the Mii Brawler lacks tools to force approaches and has to make hard commitments with moves such as neutral air or dash attack when approaching due to a lack of safe options.

Another issue with the Mii Brawler is the lack of reliable KO confirms at high percents. At those percentages, many of Mii Brawler's combo setups stop confirming. Many of their KO options are flawed, being extremely laggy (Such as Forward Smash and Onslaught) or having poor range (Down Smash and Up Smash). What few confirming moves Mii Brawler does have at these percents in landing up aerial or neutral aerial can cause Mii Brawler to become predictable. Because of this, they must rely on back aerial, out of shield options, hard reads and tech-chasing to secure stocks without assistance from confirms.

Overall, the Mii Brawler is a jack of all trades amalgamation of all hand-to-hand based fighters. The ability to mix and match several different special moves adds a unique layer of versatility by allowing several different playstyles and gameplans for the same basic fighter, making Mii Brawler among the most unpredictable to fight against. Additionally, a Mii Brawler experienced in several movesets will be able to update their moveset to better combat their opponent, such as using Helicopter Kick for heavier opponents or Soaring Axe Kick versus characters with disjoints. However, all of the customizable special moves have a flaw to prevent them from being overpowered and/or are an inferior version of a similar move other fighters possess, such as Feint Jump to Flip Jump or Head-On Assault to Bowser Bomb . The character's very good frame data, above-average mobility, and a variety of moves that can combo, juggle, and secure KOs are held back by their poor range and limited off-stage presence due to their fast fall speed. While their strengths do overshadow their weaknesses, many players have considered the Mii Brawler to be generally inferior to characters who have a similar fighting archetype such as Mario and Squirtle.</p>
