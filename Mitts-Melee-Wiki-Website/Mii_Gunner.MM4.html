<h1>Mii Gunner</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>The Mii Gunner has been redesigned to be the slow, yet durable combatant of the three Mii Fighters. They are tied with Link, Yoshi, Captain Falcon, and Min Min in terms of weight, possess an average walking speed, the 5th slowest dashing speed, and 14th slowest air speed in the game. As with the other two Mii Fighter types, the Gunner has access to 12 different special moves: Charge Blast, Laser Blaze, and Grenade Launch (Neutral Special), Flame Pillar, Stealth Burst, and Gunner Missile (Side Special), Lunar Launch, Cannon Jump Kick, and Arm Rocket (Up Special), and Echo Reflector, Bomb Drop, and Absorbing Vortex (Down Special).

Like the other Mii Fighters, one of the primary strengths of the Mii Gunner is their diverse set of versatile specials. As the long range and projectile-heavy Mii Fighter, many of their specials excel at neutralizing approaches, racking up damage, edgeguarding, and shield pressure from a distance. Charge Blast is a very good KO'ing option which is extremely consistent, quick, and powerful when fully charged. Gunner Missile are both good at spacing and keeping enemies out. The Super variant deals a solid bit of damage and knockback while the Homing variant can wall out approaches and also help the Gunner initiate approaches of their own. Laser Blaze racks up decent damage while also causing flinching, making it a valuable tool similar to Falco and Fox's Blaster. Finally, Flame Pillar and Bomb Drop are both good tools for ledgetrapping and setting up kill confirms. A bomb drop at mid-high percentages can reliably confirm into back aerial while an opponent trapped in Flame Pillar can be combo'd into a fully charged Charge Blast. Additionally, the Mii Gunner can also further solidify their defensive playstyle with the usage of Echo Reflector and Absorbing Vortex, both of which aid in countering other campy or projectile-based characters.

Accompanying the Mii Gunner's vast collection of zoning specials is a very interesting and varying set of normals. While many of the Gunner's normals suffer from mild ending lag, they either possess high KO'ing power or range. Forward smash and up aerial are both among the longest-ranged moves in the game (the latter which can secure very early KO's at the top of the blast line and the former being an excellent way of reading rolls and covering landing options), forward tilt and neutral air are good tools to push pressuring opponents off of them, and forward aerial is a very useful move, which not only can edgeguard and space opponents from a distance due to it being a projectile, but it also can be used to perform a technique called gundashing, which is an excellent technique that significantly helps mitigate the Mii Gunner's lacking mobility and their recovery. Alongside the aforementioned moves are a slew of moves that have respectable KO'ing power such as up smash, up tilt, down tilt, down smash, and back aerial.

Lastly, the Mii Gunner has adequate choices for recovery. With the exception of Cannon Jump Kick, Lunar Launch and Arm Rocket both provide a fantastic amount of distance, especially Arm Rocket which has far more control both horizontally and vertically. This combined with their heavy weight gives the Mii Gunner a decent ability to survive at higher percents.

Of course, the Gunner does not come without their flaws. While many of their moves have tremendous range or KO'ing power, most of them are very laggy. This is especially prominent with their up and down tilt, which both have decent start up, but significant ending lag while moves that are fast such as forward tilt and neutral air have poor range and KO potential. As a result, they struggle to acquire reliable KOs outside of a fully charged Charge Blast.

While the Mii Gunner's array of special moves are all very potent, there are some that do not come without their weaknesses. Laser Blaze is a fairly slow and easily interceptible projectile, Grenade Launch travels in a very slow and short-ranged arc that no longer can be charged or controlled, Flame Pillar has relatively substantial lag on both ends and doesn't last as long as other flame-arc moves, and Bomb Drop can be hit back to the Gunner, making them a poor choice to use against opponents with disjoints.

As mentioned before, the Mii Gunner has terrible mobility. Their air speed, dashing speed, and initial dashing speed are among the slowest in the game, making them a very sluggish fighter both on the ground and in the air outside of gundashing. Additionally, their status as a heavyweight makes them very easy to combo despite their decent survivability and while their recoveries are good, they do not come without their weaknesses. Arm Rocket possesses no damaging hitbox despite its fantastic mobility and distance, Lunar Launch, while in possession of good vertical distance and a relatively powerful projectile, has poor horizontal distance, and Cannon Jump Kick is a terrible recovery move, providing very little distance both horizontally and vertically while also being very slow and easily intercepted.

Overall, the Mii Gunner is a jack of all trades amalgamation of all projectile based fighters. The ability to mix and match several different special moves adds a unique layer of versatility by allowing several different playstyles for the same basic fighter, making Mii Gunner among the most unpredictable to fight against. However, all of the customizable special moves have a fatal flaw to prevent them from being overpowered and/or are an inferior version of a similar move other fighters possess. Their strengths do marginally outweight their weaknesses and as a result, is a fighter that excels at walling out opponents while struggling up close. Their multitude of projectiles provide them with countless options to keep opponents away, rack up damage, and edgeguard. However they must be mindful and extremely careful, as one mistake can cause them to take a huge chunk of damage. They are a relatively simple character to pick up with a playstyle similar to Samus and can be a potent zoner, though due to their aforementioned weaknesses, they are considered to be an inferior zoner like that of Samus, Snake, and the Belmonts.</p>
