<h1>Isabelle</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Isabelle is a moderately short and floaty lightweight with slow overall mobility. As a semi-clone of her fellow Animal Crossing fighter Villager, she is similar to him in many aspects. However, Isabelle is also lighter and floatier, has faster grounded and aerial mobility, and cannot wall jump. Moreover, Isabelle also has multiple attacks that are unique to her (such as all three of her smash attacks), while even the moves she shares with Villager have different animations and mechanics.

Isabelle's grounded moves have their utility mainly due to their range and low startup, as all of her standard grounded moves have less than 10 frames of startup barring her grab. Neutral attack is Isabelle's fastest grounded move, and while it is a weak single-hit move, it can be used to combo into her smash attacks at high percentages, and can also be used to jab lock opponents reliably; forward tilt is useful for spacing thanks to its decent knockback and range, while also serving as a situational KOing move at higher percents near the ledge; up tilt can be used for combos and juggles thanks to its relatively fast speed and low knockback; down tilt possesses decent range, while the sweetspot close to her is a respectably powerful KOing option at high percents; and dash attack is a projectile that can be used off of platforms against opponents on the ground or on lower platforms, and it can also be used near the ledge for edgeguarding or potentially as a 2 frame punish. Her smash attacks also have some utility as well: forward smash is her strongest grounded KOing option if sweetspotted; up smash hits twice and is her best vertical KO move while also comboing into up aerial at low percents; and down smash is a semi-spike that can be used for KOing near the ledge, edgeguarding, and 2 frame punishes.

Isabelle's aerials autocancel in a short hop and each one has a distinct perk. Neutral aerial is Isabelle's fastest aerial and her best out of shield option, and it is a sex kick that can be used to combo into Isabelle's other moves or break out of combos. Forward and back aerials have her fire slingshot projectiles that are useful for approaching, spacing and edgeguarding; back aerial has slower startup but less ending lag than forward aerial, and is stronger as well. Finally, up and down aerials have her always swing two turnips as opposed to also one or three like Villager, making them more consistent overall; up aerial is a good follow-up from up tilt, is useful for juggling, and the clean hit can even act as a situational KOing move near the upper blast line, while down aerial's clean hit is capable of meteor smashing if sweetspotted, while otherwise launching opponents on the Sakurai angle, enabling it to be used for edgeguarding. The inability to tech grounded meteor smashes also gives sweetspotted clean down aerial limited combo potential at higher percents as well. Combined with her ability to maintain offstage presence due to her floaty nature, Isabelle's mix of fast and ranged aerials make edgeguarding one of the focal points of her strengths.

Her grab game also has some utility. Isabelle uses a net as part of her tether grab, which has a longer range than normal grabs, but more startup and ending lag as a result; however, Isabelle does not have a grab aerial in spite of her long-ranged grab. Isabelle can also use her grab to pocket items as well. Down throw can be used to initiate aerial combos, forward throw can setup edgeguards by throwing opponents off the stage, and back throw is a potent KO throw, being among the top ten of back throws in terms of kill power. Up throw deals decent damage, but its lack of utility aside from that makes it Isabelle's least useful throw.

Isabelle sports versatile special moves. Her neutral special, Pocket, allows her to steal an opponent's projectile and send it back at them, helping to discourage projectile camping against her. Her down special, Lloid Trap, has her planting Lloid into the ground. Lloid Trap will active whenever an opponent walks over Lloid or can be activated manually, making it useful for surprising opponents, though it also takes notable time to plant and leaves her vulnerable, not being active until frame 51. However, despite this flaw, Lloid establishes another notable strength Isabelle possesses, ledge trapping; when planted in the correct position, Lloid alone can cover rolling and jumping get up's while Isabelle herself can attempt to cover other get-up options, allowing her to have an easier time maintaining advantage. In addition, Lloid has other forms of utility; it can combo into up aerial if Isabelle is close enough, making it a KO confirm at higher percents. Lloid also has the niche application known as "Glyroid"; when manually detonating Lloid during her initial dash, Isabelle will quickly slide a short distance, allowing it to be used as a movement mix-up for approaching. Her side special, Fishing Rod, is a command grab that allows her to grab and throw opponents from distances farther than her grab can, and it also functions as a tether recovery and an edgeguarding tool, as the fact that it can hang offstage allows her to catch opponents with slower recoveries. Her up special, Balloon Trip, provides incredibly long vertical and horizontal distance, though it travels a slightly shorter distance than Villager's version. This, in addition to her Fishing Rod's great horizontal distance, gives Isabelle an outstanding recovery.

However, Isabelle is not without her flaws, the most notable of which being her disadvantage state; due to her floatiness and light weight, Isabelle struggles at getting back to the ground quickly and is therefore quite vulnerable to juggling and early KO's, all while the fact that her aerials provide little coverage below her and that she has no way to mix up her already floaty movement outside of B-reversing Pocket further accentuate this problem.

Many of her special moves have major flaws. While her Fishing Rod is a versatile command grab with a very good range, it is flawed in many ways. Unlike all other grabs in the game, it is unusually capable of being shielded and suffers from a lot of ending lag, making it very punishable. Lloid Trap is also very flawed; planting Lloid leaves her vulnerable and takes 51 frames to be active, it disappears after only 10 seconds and can easily be destroyed due to it only having 8% of HP, and in some cases the resulting explosion will damage Isabelle herself and some characters can even run through it without getting affected. While Isabelle's recovery is very long-distanced, she has no way to defend herself while using Balloon Trip, due to the move lacking a hitbox, and popping the balloons will render her helpless, meaning that despite her recovery being fairly good on paper, it can easily be edgeguarded in practice. Finally, Isabelle loses some of Villager's most important tools for zoning in the neutral game, namely Lloid Rocket and Timber, making her noticeably worse at zoning than her counterpart.

Overall, Isabelle is a more well-rounded character than Villager, having inferior zoning and camping ability, but better mobility and a more reliable set of standard attacks in comparison. However, her special attacks have notable flaws and she has inferior endurance due to her lighter weight and slower falling speed. Because of this, she is often seen as an inferior counterpart to Villager. This has resulted in a negative competitive reception, as many top professional players view her not only as an inferior counterpart to Villager (who by himself has rather mixed competitive reception and poor tournament representation), but also potentially as one of the worst characters in the game. Her tournament representation reflects this, as it is very poor in all regions, and her most significant results are either from the very early days of Ultimate's meta, or her being used as a secondary or pocket to other characters. However, due to her low popularity in tournaments, it is debatable whether Isabelle is actually a poor character, or her representation is poor simply because of dedicated mains. As such, her true standing in the meta remains to be seen.
