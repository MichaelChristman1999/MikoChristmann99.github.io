<h1>Min Min</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Although Min Min's physique is athletic and slender, her enormous ARMS and the accessories attached to them grant her above-average weight, weighing as much as Link, Yoshi, Captain Falcon, and Mii Gunner. Her base stats are true to this weight class as well, with an average walking speed, the twentieth slowest dashing speed, and the sixth slowest air speed. As a playable character from ARMS, Min Min's playstyle can be considered a hybrid of Little Mac and Simon's, with an emphasis on both strong punches and keeping foes at a distance. However, while her punches have the most melee range of any attack in the game, their hitboxes are strictly located on her ARMS' "fists". Altogether, this means that in comparison to other characters dependent on spacing (such as Marth or Corrin), much stricter attack positioning is crucial to keeping distance from opponents.

Min Min's biggest strength is arguably the sheer versatility of her moveset. Her down special, ARMS Change, allows her to swap between three ARMS which can be equipped to her right ARM: the Ramram, which is not as powerful as her other ARMS but can be angled in a wider arc, the Megawatt, which lacks in speed and range but compensates with high power, and the Dragon, which can fire a laser if the attack button for Min Min's respective ARM is held down. ARMS Change does not incur any ending lag, allowing her to swap her right ARM instantly as needed, allowing for a potential surprise attack. Min Min can uniquely attack with one ARM and use the other one mid-attack (and can do so in entirely different directions), as the A button triggers attacks with her left ARM, while the B button triggers attacks with her right. This effect also applies to her forward smash attacks, granting her a distinctly high damage dispensing ceiling. While this effectively deprives her of any traditional neutral or side special as used by other characters, this gives her a very strong mix-up game, as she can use both ARMS to catch foes off guard before attacking, and also cover a myriad of tech chasing options. She can also jump mid-punch, giving her a decent ground-to-air game, although this is mostly effective when Ramram is active, due to its vertical coverage.

In the air, Min Min's forward and back aerials retain the same function as they do on the ground, though she uniquely has the ability to perform forward smashes while airborne. This allows her to sport KO potential even in air-to-air engagements, as well as giving her additional unique landing options. Her neutral aerial spins the ARM currently equipped to Min Min's right ARM in a circular motion, which can be reliably spaced and used as a defensive option. Uniquely, her airborne neutral special is nearly identical to her neutral aerial, while utilizing her currently equipped right ARM instead of her left. Although the different ARMS sport different traits in terms of startup, speed and active frames, they all have the same amount of landing lag. The Megawatt version of Min Min's airborne neutral special is notably capable of KOing, while the Ramram version can combo into itself at low percentages, and lead into forward and back aerial combos, which in some circumstances may lead to early KOs.

One of Min Min's most atypical but valuable perks is her ability to keep pressure and potentially start combos far from harm's way. Being able to consecutively string multiple tilts and forward smashes into one another allows Min Min to hit confirm into extreme amounts of damage from afar with a comparatively few amounts of hits. With the right precision and spacing, Min Min can cause an onslaught of constant attacks that can combo into one another without any risk of retaliation, while continuously remaining in a position to do it again. This is especially dangerous when any character is offstage, as any who try to recover horizontally are at risk of being KO'd even at 0% thanks to the sheer range provided by Min Min's ARMS. While she is afforded safety from on-stage against horizontal recoveries, the speed of Min Min's attacks in the air grant her plenty of opportunities in edge-guarding from off-stage as well, and ARMS Jump allows her to pursue and edgeguard opponents who recover high. Depending on the currently equipped ARM, Min Min can even beat out oncoming projectiles from characters attempting to pressure her from afar. The core of her security is from the inability to counter an ARM at mid to long-range in any way that would put her at risk, and no ARM nor any of their effects can be reflected.

While punches comprise the bulk of her moveset, she has a handful of kick-based attacks that also have utility. Her down tilt is a sliding kick that, despite its poor damage output, allows her to approach foes reliably due to its speed and distance covered, and it can also start combos. Her dash attack gives her a solid burst option given her lack in mobility, can lead to follow-ups at low percentages, and is able to cross-up shields when used at close range. Her up aerial has a good horizontal range in front of her that makes it good for performing combos on landing, while her down aerial is decently strong and can function as a combo breaker if there is enough vertical distance. Her up smash and down smash have great power when sweetspotted, being very strong KO options. Both Min Min's up smash and up tilt have very fast startup, as well as great vertical range, giving her both a strong out of shield option and solid anti-air. Additionally, her up smash has the unique properties of sporting a reflector hitbox, which is active one frame before its attack hitbox, and has one persistent reflector hitbox in front of her for the duration of the move, as well as moving ones on her legs. Because of the reflector being applied to her up smash, she sports the fastest out of shield reflector in the game, and is able to cover both close-range approaches and point-blank projectile options.

Min Min also has a strong grab game, with her grab having the second-longest reach of all grabs in the game and all of her throws dealing at least 8%. Her forward throw can force opponents offstage and set up easy tech chase combos at lower percentages, her up and back throws have strong KO potential, and her down throw, despite its inability to start combos reliably, can still follow up if the opponent does not react accordingly. Throwing also has the benefit of giving her left Dragon ARM a boost in power. This charged-up state lasts for 20 seconds, barring the sustaining of heavy knockback, and gives her a damage and knockback boost on any attack made with her left Dragon ARM, including its laser. However, one key flaw with her grab is that it has the longest startup of any grab in the game, and considerable end lag if missed, rendering it a risky option to use in neutral and largely saved for landing and whiff punishing.

Despite all of Min Min's unique perks, her moveset does come with weaknesses. As her ARMS' hitboxes are located on her "fists", foes can easily close in on her if she makes a mistake in spacing or timing her punches. While the Ramram's wide curving arc can somewhat alleviate this, its hitboxes are rendered inactive during the last few frames of retraction, requiring her to properly move, time and alternate between ARMS in order to offset her vulnerability, giving her a notably high skill floor. Since this problem is not shared with other range-dependent fighters (such as Shulk), this means that there are bound to be blind spots on Min Min's fist attacks, even against larger characters.

One downside to Min Min's more streamlined playstyle is her relative lack of variance between individual moves. Lacking normal forward tilts and relying on her forward smash, forward aerial and neutral moves means that Min Min's main moves are far more prone to staling than other characters. Even with the various ARMS to swap between, their counter-play remains relatively similar across all three. Many of her moves are meant for combat from much greater distances, and while she sports many close-range moves with fast startup as a last line of defense, they are generally plagued with notable end lag, making them highly committal and punishable if whiffed or blocked. This means that characters with high mobility are particularly difficult for Min Min to fight, especially if they have high damage-per-second or KO power, as she lacks tools to handle them up close as well as any easy way to keep them at bay without committing to high vulnerability reads.

Min Min further suffers from her very poor disadvantage state. She has almost no moves to break out of disadvantage once she is in it, lacking any functional combo breakers outside of situational usage of down and neutral aerials. This, coupled with her slow fall speed, makes her prone to getting juggled. Her up special has a long range as a tether recovery, but will only work if Min Min is sufficiently close to a ledge, which means that any stray aerial from any character may be enough to edge-guard and gimp her, even at surprisingly low percents. This is compounded by her abysmal air speed, which makes both recovering and avoiding repeated attacks all the more difficult. Finally, while she has more range to control and threaten with than any other character, she can occasionally struggle with being conditioned by opponents in the neutral game. Her up smash, despite uniquely acting as a reflector, is highly committal, making it an inferior option against certain projectile users such as Mega Man or the Links, as they can pressure her with multiple fast projectiles that her reflector is unable to account for. While her ARMS can beat out weaker projectiles, there are quite a few that either clank or have transcendent priority, which forces her to play aggressively and risk slipping into her poor disadvantageous state. This issue is particularly exacerbated against characters who have reflectors of their own, and are able to reflect their own projectiles back at her.

Overall, Min Min is a character well equipped with unique tools and traits that have her play a hybrid gameplay style, incorporating elements of zoning as well as the aggressive usage of long-ranged attacks. Her fast overall frame data, strong anti-aerial prowess, and ability to alternate between attacks while retaining mobility make for a character who maintains a strong pressure game that can discombobulate opponents, allowing her to mix up her play from multiple angles in deceptive ways. Her ability to switch the traits of her attacks also gives her unique frame trapping and tech chasing capabilities, as well as a deadly edge-guarding game. This adds up to Min Min having a profound snowball effect whenever she gains advantage in battle. However, the combination of her precise hitboxes, sub-par disadvantage state, punishable frame data on select key moves, and high learning curve means that the player is going to have to have the ingenuity to master precision, proper conditioning, and reads in order to combat opponents who are capable of rushing her down, playing a stronger defensive game, or taking advantage of her blind spots.

Because of the impact that COVID-19 has had on competitive events around the world, Min Min's potential remains to be fully ascertained. Despite this, she has amassed a notable amount of players with strong competitive results in Japan - where offline tournaments have continued relatively unabated - potentially showing early signs of Min Min being a very strong contender at a top competitive level.</p>
