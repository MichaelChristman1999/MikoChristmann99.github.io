<h1>Simon Belmont</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Simon is a heavyweight fighter with a handful of effective projectiles and incredibly long disjointed attacks. In turn, he is burdened with poor mobility, especially in the air, and shares his attributes with his descendant and Echo Fighter, Richter; despite having the 8th-fastest falling and fast falling speed, he has below-average gravity, the 4th slowest walk speed, the 13th-slowest dash and air speed, and is tied with Snake for the lowest air acceleration in the game. He also has the 5th lowest traction, tied with Bowser Jr. and King Dedede.

One of Simon's most notable traits are his notorious projectiles within his special moves. Firstly, Axe is a very strong projectile that can be thrown in three angles, which makes it effective at both edgeguarding and a threatening anti-air option, compounded by its ability to go through solid terrain. The axe can additionally lead into forward aerial, or, at higher percents, Uppercut for a KO. His side special, the Cross, functions like a boomerang, though unlike other boomerang projectiles, it does not follow Simon, instead going straight and then briefly going backwards on its own if not grabbed by Simon; in addition to this, it sends opponents vertically in the air with low knockback, which is favorable for setups into aerial attacks, the Axe or an up smash. His up special, Uppercut, is a very fast out of shield option with decent kill power that has multiple setups into it, such as the Cross, or more notably, down aerial. Finally, his down special, Holy Water is a great projectile for ledge-trapping, combo setups or kill setups such as a forward smash, forward tilt, or Uppercut; its flame effect also enables it to detonate Young Link and Toon Link's bombs as well as Link's Remote Bombs.

Simon's other notable trait is his impressive range. His Vampire Killer whip offers the overall second longest disjointed range out of any fighter in the roster, and it makes his overall kit well-rounded and versatile. In the air, despite his aerial mobility being sluggish, his aerials are effective in their own rights; his up, forward and back aerials all have impressive range and can be used as tether recoveries, along with the latter two having the unique ability to be angled. His down aerial, while lacking the disjoint of his other aerials, is a notoriously effective combo tool, as it functions much like Greninja's down aerial; it meteor smashes at the beginning, but what makes it versatile is its late hit. On the late hit, both Simon and the opponent will bounce back up at diagonal angles, which opens up many KO confirms, notably into his Uppercut. At low percentages, it can combo into itself multiple times, which can potentially make it a zero-to-death tool if the opponent reacts poorly.

Simon's range is also effective on the ground, as his sluggish frame data is compensated by his attacks having immense range and power at the spiked ball at the end of the whip, to the point where they can be considered safe on shield if spaced, despite their lag. All of his smash attacks are notable examples of this; his forward smash is very powerful when tippered, and when combined with its ability to be angled, this makes it a deadly edgeguarding and ledge-trapping tool. His up smash is very strong when tippered, making it a reliable anti-air tool and a combo finisher and KO confirm out of his Cross. His down smash hits on both sides like most others, and keeps his trademark range while possessing decent power when sweetspotted. His forward tilt possesses decent range and uncharacteristically low ending lag, his dash attack is relatively quick and effective for crossing up shielding opponents, and his down tilt, while not disjointed, is a unique two-hit move that causes him to pseudo-crawl, allowing him to cross up foes or effectively retreat from the corner. Due to Simon's excellent range and his three projectiles, he is very good at keeping the opponent at bay.

Simon also has a good grab game. His grab has below-average range and possesses noticeable lag, but his dash grab gives him a lot of momentum due to his low traction. His throws also have great utility: his forward and back throws have good KO potential despite their rather quick speed, and can be used to set up edgeguards otherwise. His up throw is considered to be his most useful throw, as its decent damage is compounded with its great setup ability, being able to start juggles. His down throw is rather situational and is his least used throw, but nevertheless has combo potential thanks to Simon's range.

Despite all these strengths, Simon has some glaring weaknesses. Perhaps his most infamous shortcoming is his extremely poor recovery, being among the worst in the game, despite having three aerials function as tether recoveries; his very low air movement, combined with Uppercut offering very poor vertical and horizontal momentum, give him very poor offstage presence. As such, he is very easy to gimp, and overall has a slim chance to return to the ledge, making him easy to KO despite his good endurance due to his almost non-existent offstage game. This is further compounded with Simon's susceptibility to combos due to his heavyweight status, poor aerial attributes, and lack of effective combo breakers within his moveset, preventing him from easily getting out of combos or escaping pressure. Due to his very low traction and slow attacks, he also has a poor out of shield game outside of Uppercut.

Despite his zoning and spacing potential, it is overall burdened by his poor frame data, lackluster overall mobility, and narrow attacks. His slow movement makes him vulnerable to pressure and zoning. To make things worse, he only has one aerial move that comes out before frame 10, and that is his frame 8 neutral aerial, while forward back and up aerials come out on frame 14 and down aerial on frame 13. While he has his projectiles, they each have noticeable startup and are susceptible to being reflected back, which can be a huge turnabout, especially since the projectiles play a huge role in Simon's neutral game. An opponent can also catch Holy Water mid-flight and use it against Simon, as he can only have one out at a time, allowing his opponents to perform combo setups or kill setups on him.

Simon's poor frame data also gives him a mediocre close-range game, as many of his attacks are unsafe if not spaced properly, which often leaves him heavily susceptible to punishment. While Simon's whip attacks have excellent range, they are also very narrow, and some attacks, such as up tilt, up smash and up aerial only hit directly above Simon, giving him poor hitbox placements and creating big blindspots that can cause them to miss opponents even if they are directly touching him, which hampers his juggle ability and overall punish game, and gives him a hard time hitting smaller characters. Finally, his moves tend to be rather weak when sourspotted, making spacing crucial if the player plans to score an early KO. With his grab range being below-average and his kill power being noticeable with his tipper mechanic, he must keep his space and fish for tippered tilts and aerials for maximum effect, in a similar vein to Marth.

Overall, Simon is a fighter who excels when he is distanced from his opponent and controlling the main stage: he should use his variety of projectiles to keep opponents at a workable distance to take full advantage of his spectacular range, all while avoiding getting sent offstage due to his poor offstage survivability.

In direct comparison to his Echo Fighter, Richter, who is almost fully identical to him with only one single difference, Simon has seen smaller representation on his own. The two, however, have seen below-average results in the current metagame due to their shared weaknesses.</p>
