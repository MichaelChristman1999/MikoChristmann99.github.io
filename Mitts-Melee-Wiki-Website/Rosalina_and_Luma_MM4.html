<h1>Rosalina and Luma</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Rosalina is a tall and floaty lightweight, much like Mewtwo, and Zelda. Rosalina is tied with Falco for being the fourteenth-lightest character in the game, and unlike Peach or Zelda, her overall grounded mobility is decent, thanks to her above-average initial dash speed and slightly above-average walking and dashing speeds. She has average air speed, the second-best additional air acceleration values in the game (behind Palutena and tied with Mega Man) and excellent jump and double jump height; additionally, her falling and fast falling speeds are among the slowest, while her gravity is the second lowest in the game. Lastly, the combination of her high jump height, low gravity and slow falling speed give her the longest jump duration in the cast, allowing her more than one second (71 frames) in the air with an uninterrupted full hop. As a result of these attributes, she is a very floaty character with superb aerial mobility and an ability to remain airborne longer than most other characters in the game.

Due to being allied with Luma, Rosalina also follows the tag team archetype established by the Ice Climbers, and perpetuated by Olimar. Luma can remain next to Rosalina to attack with her, or it can be sent away with Luma Shot to attack from a distance. This allows Rosalina numerous possibilities to attack opponents, as she can essentially create combos by "pinballing" opponents back and forth between herself and Luma. Luma mechanically functions like a blend of Pikmin and Nana of the Ice Climbers: it uses a hit points (HP) mechanic like the former, in which it will be KOed if it is dealt 40%, and it responds to player inputs like the latter. Unlike Olimar, Rosalina cannot immediately summon Luma once it is KO'd, which forces her to wait 10 seconds (7 seconds if three players are present, and 5 seconds if four or more players are present) until another Luma appears. Luma also cannot experience status effects, such as stun or sleep, which can allow it to attack and fend off opponents if Rosalina happens to find herself put under a status effect that renders her unable to move or attack. Luma also cannot be grabbed, and is able to act when Rosalina herself does get grabbed.

While they are largely defensive characters, Rosalina & Luma have several offensive options that allow them to rack up damage if given the opportunity. They have many attacks with disjointed hitboxes, most notably each of Rosalina's aerials, which are also very useful for racking up damage. Their neutral aerial is a fast, low commitment option with upwards knockback, perfectly complimenting their aerial and juggling oriented fighting style. Her forward aerial keeps the opponent in place, hits multiple times, and combos well with her down throw like Ness' same combo. Despite having a large multi-hitting hitbox, it has the longest amount of landing lag out of her aerials and is generally unsafe on shield. Her and Luma's back aerials are quick semi-spikes and can be used in a wide range of scenarios, such as edge-guarding and spacing. Their up aerial is a capable attack, as it possesses outstanding disjointed range and can KO off the top of some stages when used properly. Although their slowest, down aerial is also a very potent edge-guarding option: Rosalina's hitbox is very large, hard to challenge from below due to its duration, and capable of meteor smashing, whereas Luma's hitbox can easily KO outright thanks to its very high knockback growth and sending opponents directly outward.

Rosalina also has access to a unique advanced technique called Lunar Landing. If Rosalina inputs an aerial attacks right as she lands, the aerial will not come out and she will land without enduring any landing lag (Unless using down air), but Luma will continue performing its respective aerial attack. This allows for greater mix-up and follow-up potential, as well as mindgames, but requires Luma in order to actually be performed. Their dash grab also has a similar occurrence, where if Rosalina performs a dash attack and instantly grabs, Rosalina will perform a dash grab while Luma will perform its respective dash attack. This makes their dash grab a lot safer, and means they can deal an extra 3% just by landing the grab. When coupled with Rosalina's reliable set of throws, these traits give her and Luma even greater mix-up potential, as well as more approaching and punishing options. Using the attack canceling feature built into Ultimate's mechanics, Rosalina can preform one move while Luma does a tilt or dash attack. This also allows for multiple combos and mindgames.

Rosalina & Luma are also gifted with a good set of smash attacks. Their forward smash possesses a large amount of range, making it very useful to finish off opponents. While it has the highest knockback growth out of Rosalina's attacks, it requires Luma's involvement to achieve its true KO potential and range, which is among the best in the game. Their up smash has minimal start-up and, while it possesses less range, is still a great KOing option regardless due to rendering Rosalina's head intangible throughout its duration. Lastly, their down smash is a useful anti-pressure option thanks to it having less start-up and especially ending lag in comparison to their other smashes. Due to it also being a semi-spike, it can also be used for edge-guarding. As of 13.0, it is now stronger, allowing it to K.O better on top of its existing utility. Luma can also perform smash attacks away from Rosalina so, in a scenario where it is not safe to approach the opponent to KO, Rosalina still can attempt to KO by sending Luma out.

Rosalina and Luma's special moves give them special utility inaccesible to any other character. Luma Shot gives Rosalina a method to attack safely from a distace and gives them superior ledge guarding capabilities. Star Bits, their side special move, is a very good tool for keeping opponents away from. It cannot be clanked with and has long lasting hitboxes, allowing it to stop fast approaches like a Sonic Spin Dash. When used properly, Rosalina is practically immune to projectiles via Gravitational Pull. While it does not deal damage, it causes Rosalina to completely nullify any projectile near her. Despite not being a reflector, it shares the same ability of making incoming items and projectiles come under Rosalina's ownership, which means any opponents can be damaged by the orbiting item or projectile if they are too close. In addition, Gravitational Pull activates on frame 4 and has very little ending lag, making it difficult for an opponent to punish her for using it. This allows Rosalina to virtually shut down projectile-reliant playstyles of zoning-oriented characters such as Villager, as their over-reliance on projectiles causes them to have a difficult time fighting her so long as Gravitational Pull is properly used. Although situational, Gravitational Pull can also gimp certain recoveries, with the best examples being PK Thunder; Rosalina can immediately pull away the PSI lightning bolt projectile before Ness or Lucas can use it to recover, rendering them helpless as a result. Aside from Gravitational Pull, Luma can also be used to block projectiles, although this comes at the cost of depleting its HP.

Despite her various strengths, Rosalina has noticeable weaknesses. Her tall height sometimes makes it very hard to avoid attacks, while her light weight causes her to be very susceptible to early KOs. Although Launch Star provides an extremely long-distanced recovery, it lacks any sort of hitbox (until Luma is able to act at the end of the move), making her vulnerable to meteor smashes. Her disadvantage state is extremely poor, as she cannot deal with juggling very well thanks to her slow falling speed and average air speed, though her very high air acceleration, invisible neutral air dodge and hard-to-contest aerials can allow her some control over mixing up her landing. Her biggest flaw, however, is that she is drastically weakened without Luma, as her respective attacks' knockback values are unimpressive and both Luma Shot and Star Bits are rendered useless. Although Luma will inevitably respawn, the 10 seconds it takes to do so can be more than enough time for the opponent to land a combo or score a KO on Rosalina. This is further compounded by Luma's inability to act out of a tumble until landing on the ground, as attacks that knock Luma off-stage will result in it being inevitably KO'd, regardless of how much HP it has. Most of the cast also has a reliable move to use in order to KO Luma and thus avoid the risk of being punished by Rosalina. However, both she and Luma have a particularly difficult time against characters with larger disjoints or fast moves that deal high base knockback, especially because Luma takes more knockback than it did in SSB4.

Overall, Rosalina & Luma have a high learning curve, where players must become comfortable with using her aerial bait-and-punish abilities as well as her grounded keep away options. Players must also learn when to separate Rosalina from Luma, as well as when to protect each during the course of a match with their various options. Mastering her unique playstyle allows for creating impressive tag-team combos and scoring KOs through strong pressure.</p>
