<h1>R.O.B.</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>R.O.B. is the eighteenth heaviest character in the game, being tied with Snake and Banjo & Kazooie, thus making him a heavyweight. R.O.B. sports an above average walking speed, initial dash, and falling speed, is tied with Ike and Bowser Jr. for the 26th fastest air speed, average dashing speed, gravity, and traction, as well as the 30th highest air acceleration. This grants him mobility that is fairly average overall, yet balanced compared to most of his fellow heavyweights. This, along with several of his other attributes, most notably his extremely long-distanced recovery, noticeably set him apart from most of them.

Like in Brawl and Smash 4, R.O.B. is a zoning-oriented character with very useful projectiles to keep his opponents at bay. Robo Beam enables him to attack from considerable distance, and becomes the noticeably stronger Super Robo Beam when it is left idle for 14.3 seconds. While Robo Beam interrupts opponents faster, Super Robo Beam deals more damage and has higher knockback growth. Gyro is an auto-chargeable projectile that becomes an item when fired. Compared to Robo Beam, it has a more favorable angle for disrupting opponents, while also being more manipulable as a projectile and having greater kill power. Thanks to R.O.B.'s item throws being among the strongest in the game, Gyro is also very useful when smash thrown as an item.

Aside from his projectiles, R.O.B's ground game is also excellent. Jab comes out on frame 3 and acts as a quick move at low percentages to escape pressure situations, and it can also jab lock and combo. Forward tilt can be useful for spacing at higher percentages since it comes out on frame 7, but its usefulness ends there. Up tilt comes out on frame 4, and is very good for acting as an anti air and combos into his up air. Down tilt is R.O.B.'s single best move, as it lowers his hurtbox, has great range, is tied with jab as his fastest move at frame 3, pressures shields, trades with shield grabs, and its total active frames is only 14, meaning it is one of the safest pressuring moves in the game. It also combos into itself at lower percentages, and at higher percents it can combo into grab or dash attack, and can send opponents into a jab lock scenario for a KO at relatively low percentages. Lastly, dash attack is useful for punishing landings and whiffs, is very fast at frame 7, has decently long range, and can combo into his forward air at low to mid percentages.

R.O.B.'s air game is also great, thanks to the excellent and disjointed ranges of all but one of his aerials. Neutral aerial has large, disjointed hitboxes that make it great for covering the opponents options if they lack the range to deal with it. It's also very hard to punish out of shield, due to its damage, total landing lag (7 frames) and range. It is also a reliable combo starter at low to medium percentages when SHFF'd, as well as a useful spacing option and, to a lesser extent, a kill move. Up aerial is a great vertical kill move due to its large and long-lasting hitboxes, fast startup, and the last hit’s high knockback. Back and down aerials are R.O.B.'s most damaging aerials when sweetspotted, and they too have large hitboxes, much like neutral aerial. However, they also boast their own specific strengths. Back air has recovery potential thanks to it propelling R.O.B. forward, and it's his only aerial that can KO in neutral due to its very high knockback and huge hitbox. Not only that, but it is also one of the strongest back aerials in the game. Down air is a meteor smash that can hit below the ledge and KO very early if done so. It is also active for 6 whole frames, making it difficult to avoid for characters with linear recoveries. Lastly, forward aerial is R.O.B.'s fastest aerial coming out on frame 6, making it very spammable in neutral due to how low committal it is to use, as it is safe on shield. However, its hitbox has much shorter range and isn't disjointed.

R.O.B.'s grab game also has its uses. Forward and back throws are decent for spacing and setting up edge-guards. Back throw can also KO at the ledge at very high percents, and both can combo into dash attack or gyro at very low percents. In comparison, R.O.B.'s up throw is much more useful. It is his most damaging throw, a solid kill move (especially when boosted by rage or if he lands on a platform), and can even be used for combos at low percentages. His down throw, despite not being a kill move, is also one of his best tools for taking a stock. While it deals poor damage, it buries opponents, allowing for followups into up tilt, up air, or even up smash. However, with mashing, the opponent can typically get out before R.O.B. has any chance to act. As such, it is more of a read-based tool rather than a guaranteed method for taking a stock.

Although R.O.B. possesses a large number of strengths, he does also have a few noteworthy shortcomings. Despite having a good chunk of moves with respectable KO potential, landing his kill moves can be problematic because of them either being laggy or having unimpressive ranges, or possibly even both. The latter trait is particularly noticeable in regard to R.O.B.'s arm-based attacks, most of which have short ranges. His grab game is also hindered by his overall grab range being the shortest in the game.

In addition to R.O.B.'s hitbox issues, his hurtbox also hinders him, as it is very large and wide, meaning he can get hit by a lot of combos that other characters such as Jigglypuff would have an easier time getting away from. This also means that he has difficulty dealing with combo-oriented characters, such as Pikachu and Mario. This is further compounded by his above average falling speed, as well as his aerials' inability to reliably break combos: neutral and down aerials are very slow in terms of startup, forward and up aerials only hit in front of and above R.O.B., respectively, and back aerial is a mix of both: it has slow startup and only hits behind him.

Overall, R.O.B. is a non-traditional heavyweight zoner. His decently fast mobility and overall above average frame data allow him to easily pressure unwary opponents, and he doesn’t have too much trouble killing if he can get the advantage. While his overall range is rather small for a zoner like him, it is functional in the long run regardless. However, R.O.B. players must be very cautious, as a single combo can be all it takes to get R.O.B. in an uncomfortable position or possibly even kill him, thanks to his large size, moderately high weight, above average falling speed, and lack of options to break free from combos.</p>
