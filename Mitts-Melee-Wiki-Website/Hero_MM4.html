<h1>Hero</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Hero is a tall, middleweight swordsman. As a result, he has long range and his overall damage output is fittingly above-average, but he is prone to being hit easily and is very susceptible to combos. Hero has respectable overall mobility: he has a slow walking speed, slightly below-average air speed and poor air acceleration, but his dashing speed, initial dash, traction, falling speed, and fast falling speed are all either average or above-average.

Hero has a good defensive game. Similar to the three Links, Hero actually sports two shields: the standard shield action that every fighter has, and another equipped on his left arm most of the time. Hero's shield can block projectiles while he is standing idle, walking, or crouching. The wearable shield also affects the first hit of Hero's forward tilt by granting invincibility to his left arm, head and left leg because of this shield's position, similarly to Palutena's dash attack and back aerial.

Hero possesses a unique fighter ability called the MP Gauge, which has a maximum of 100 Magic Points (MP) and will deplete whenever he uses a special move. MP is restored whenever he hits opponents with attacks, and also restores gradually over time. Although his special moves completely rely on the MP Gauge, they possess tremendous utility. His neutral special, Frizz, is a fireball that travels fast, far and deals decent damage, allowing Hero to disrupt enemy approaches. In addition, unlike other Frizz spells, Frizz has low vertical knockback, making it possible to start juggles or even true combos. Frizz can be charged into Frizzle, which can beat other projectiles and KO near the ledge at reasonable percentages, or Kafrizz for even more damage, knockback and traveling distance, turning it into a viable KO move even at mid percentages.

Hero's side special, Zap, has good range for its start-up, deals respectable damage and KOs at very high percentages. Zap can be charged into Zapple, which grants even more range and damage while being a vertical KO move at high percentages, or Kazap, which results in a attack that sacrifices speed and range for power, being able to KO most opponents center stage at a mere 50%. Additionally, Kazap has 15% damage-based armor, allowing it to resist oncoming attacks. Zap and its variants are disjointed melee attacks, giving them excellent range and are also immune to reflection and even absorption.

Hero's up special, Woosh, is a quick recovery move and is also Hero's fastest and most reliable out of shield punish. Woosh can be charged into Swoosh, granting more vertical distance and horizontal mobility, or Kaswoosh, which provides tremendous vertical distance. Additionally, all Woosh spells leave behind tornadoes, which serve as lingering hitboxes that can damage opponents and gimp opposing recoveries or setup into devastating setups from below the ledge. Finally, his down special, Command Selection, gives Hero a list of four random spells which offer a wide variety of effects. Most of these spells have significant advantages and little disadvantages, which can be seen here. The Command Selection can be canceled by inputting the shield button or by jumping, allowing Hero to repeatedly switch the menu of spells until he has an ideal set of them.

Hero's smash attacks all share a unique perk: they have a 1/8 chance of striking with a critical hit, doubling their damage output and significantly increasing their knockback, allowing them to KO at extremely early percentages. In addition, they cause the smash attacks to cause more shieldstun, making them slightly safer on shield. Even without this perk, Hero's smash attacks have some utility: his forward smash is his strongest smash attack in both damage and knockback, having large range to boot, making it terrific for hard reads or punishes, his up smash has high vertical range, being a reliable anti-air option, good for halting aerial opponents' approaches while remaining a good KOing tool (though it suffers from nonexistent horizontal range, being unable to hit grounded opponents), and his down smash is his weakest smash attack, though it is also his fastest and can be used to punish rolls or spot dodges. Thus, it is a reliable edge-guarding attack in its own right.

Hero's other grounded attacks still possess utility, even if they are less overwhelming than his smash attacks and special moves. Neutral attack has a respectable start-up, damage output and good range, making it good for both damage-racking at low percentages, spacing and for warding off immediate pressure. As stated earlier, forward tilt's first hit has blocking capabilities, making it a defensive option that can beat other moves or projectiles and then be followed up with a second hit—a sword slash—which offers better range, identical speed, and more power, allowing for setting up edge-guards or outright KOs near the edge.

Up tilt has wide range, which, coupled with its respectable damage output and decent startup lag, makes it a fantastic anti-air option and more consistent than up smash, along with being able to KO at high percentages. Down tilt has good range—superseding Hero's neutral attack—while offering the same speed and launching vertically; it can be used to hit opponents hanging on the edge and start set-ups. Dash attack boasts high power for an attack of its type at the cost of speed, being able to KO at a mere 80% from the edge. Lastly, Hero's up and down throws sport some utility. Up throw is his strongest throw and has situational utility as both a combo starter and KO option, being able to KO before 200%, unlike his other throws. Conversely, down throw is a good combo starter at low to medium percentages, and can lead into dangerous set-ups.

Hero's aerial moveset, while not as good as that of many other swordfighters, is impressive nonetheless. Neutral aerial has wide range around him and launches at a diagonal angle, being a situational combo starter and useful shield poking option. Forward and back aerials are both rather slow (with back aerial in particular being among the slowest of its kind), but they are respectably strong and KO middleweights beginning around 100% and 85%, respectively. Up aerial has the lowest lag out of any of Hero's aerials and deals very low damage and knockback, enabling it to effectively initiate combos into itself or other moves, or even set up KO confirms at varying percentages. Lastly, down aerial is Hero's most damaging aerial, but also one of his slowest. Its clean hit is capable of meteor smashing opponents, leading to KOs as low as 20% on offstage foes.

But for all the strengths that Hero has, they do come with a price. His access to his special moves is restricted by their reliance on MP. Without enough MP, he is unable to cast any spells, which may put him in great danger offstage as Woosh will only give him a very small boost without MP. While his Command Selection is very versatile, its random nature means that a desired spell is unlikely to be available. Command Selection also renders Hero unable to move when the menu is open, with his only options being to jump or shield, both of which cancel the move and creates a new set of spells when he uses the move again. While this often is not an issue due to most of the spells having quick startup and good range, as well as the Hero player being able to select the spell quickly, this can sometimes pose a problem if the opponent is in a prime position to punish Hero, which can force the player to sacrifice an ideal set of spells by canceling the move or cause them to panic and use the wrong spell altogether. On top of this, some of his spells have very little utility (such as Metal Slash, which deals 1% and extremely low set knockback against non-metal opponents), while one of them, Hocus Pocus, grants any one of a slew of effects, with detrimental ones outnumbering and outweighing possible benefits.

Many of Hero's attacks suffer from slow start-up lag (dash attack), high ending lag (up tilt, down tilt, and the second hit of forward tilt), or both (forward and back aerials). Hero's below-average frame data, alongside his high raw damage output and attacks' high knockback values, collectively give him a limited combo game, since only certain attacks (particularly neutral aerial, up aerial, up throw, and down throw) can successfully generate true combos. Even then, the fast start-up of Hero's grabs is offset by their very short ranges, while up and down throws' combo potentials wane noticeably past low and medium percentages, respectively. Up aerial suffers from poor range and down tilt suffers from aforementioned high ending lag, preventing it from performing any true combos. As stated earlier, his up smash's horizontal range is nonexistent, thus making it Hero's least useful move against grounded opponents.

Due to being a tall heavyweight with slightly above-average falling speed and a lack of any fast or invincible attacks, Hero is very susceptible to combos. This weakness may be exacerbated further through Hocus Pocus' giant effect, and Oomph applying a 1.2× damage multiplier to attacks that hit him.

Overall, Hero has many strengths and many weaknesses. While he does have a plethora of magic spells at his disposal, a high overall damage output, and a healthy number of strong KO options, he suffers from sluggish frame data, a susceptibility to combos, a reliance on random chance, a limited combo game, and finite resources that are slow to recharge. While there is some potential and strategy in Hero's normal moveset, victory or defeat will frequently come down to resource management and luck. While players such as Salem and Akakikusu have shown Hero's potential at tournaments, his representation has been below-average overall. As such, his viability remains up for debate.</p>
