<h1>Mewtwo</h1>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Mewtwo is a character that fills many archetypes, and despite being relatively large with a slew of powerful moves, a lightweight fighter. Its overall mobility is outstanding, as it boasts among the fastest walking, dashing, and air speeds in the game. It also possesses the highest double jump. It also has average falling speed, above average traction, and below average gravity.

Mewtwo's overall damage output is very high, primarily due to its grounded moves. Neutral attack is a decently disjointed rapid jab that regularly racks up 20% or more damage if the opponent is caught at close range, but it is unsafe on shield. Forward tilt has good range and a sweetspot that can KO near the ledge at high percents, yet also has noticeable startup and punishable endlag. In addition to its somewhat surprising amount of power, it can also be angled to serve as a niche anti-air or ledge-hanging punish option. Down tilt boasts relatively low ending lag, quick startup, and good grounded range while launching opponents at mostly vertical angles. This makes it a great neutral and combo tool, comboing into all of Mewtwo's aerials and up tilt if the opponent is hit at close range. While it is not technically safe on shield, its overall quick speed and long range make it difficult to punish if an enemy reacts too slowly.

On the contrary, down smash is safe on shield and is notorious for causing immense shield damage if it connects. Nonetheless, it is still a risky move to throw out in neutral, due to it having the most amount of startup among all of Mewtwo's smash attacks and being one of few down smashes in the entire game to only hit on one side. In contrast, up smash has the quickest startup of all Mewtwo's smash attacks and is a great anti-air to catch forced landings, but also has the highest ending lag and is generally the most punishable move in Mewtwo's kit. Forward smash has decent range, can be angled and is Mewtwo's most powerful smash attack in terms of knockback when spaced (being able to KO at mid percents close to ledge), but has noticeable endlag and is also not safe on shield if landed at close range. These traits make Mewtwo one of the strongest characters in the game in terms of outright KO power, though it is optimal for players to not play too close to opponents with quick movement, disjointed range, or attacks that are fast enough to punish any mistakes. However, Mewtwo can also use its great ground speed to move in and punish mistakes using these moves, making it necessary for high-level players to recognize when to approach offensively.

Mewtwo's aerials are some of the best in the game, with generally quick startup, low landing lag and great power. Forward aerial is a safe poke when spaced on landing, low percent combo starter and KO option. Neutral aerial is a multihit move, a combo starter at all percents, and also a safe poke when spaced. It is also Mewtwoâ€™s best out-of-shield option due to his aerial speed allowing him to safely escape pressure (compared to committing to a laggy up smash). Though his forward and neutral aerial are fast and threatening, they lack range and are only slightly disjointed. This makes Mewtwo's approach game with these moves significantly weaker against opponents that have good range or fast anti-airs. Back aerial is Mewtwo's second slowest aerial, primarily being used to wall out offstage opponents who have poor range and/or recoveries. However, it can easily be beaten by disjoints, cannot reliably hit close to ground at any height, and leaves Mewtwo's tail very vulnerable if it whiffs. As a result, it cannot fulfill the role of giving Mewtwo good effective range in the neutral game. Down aerial has the most startup of Mewtwo's aerials, but is a very strong meteor smash when sweetspotted, has a decently disjointed hitbox directly beneath Mewtwo, and can also serve as a situational low- to mid-percent combo starter.

Mewtwo's neutral special, Shadow Ball, has excellent versatility, as it can combo into virtually any of Mewtwo's quicker moves at any percent depending on the charge of the projectile. When fully charged, it also becomes a reliable KO move at high percents, and deals decent shield damage for good measure. In midair, it can even be used as a landing mixup, as the recoil from the fully charged variant pushes Mewtwo back a considerable distance. Mewtwo can utilize techs like wavebounces, B-reverses, Shadow Ball cancels and turnaround specials to make its movement even more tricky, improving its baits and punishes. However, it has a decent amount of startup, making it risky to use at close range. Its side special, Confusion, is a command grab with decent range that doubles as a somewhat slow but very active reflector and can be used for combo setups, though alert opponents can react out of it before Mewtwo below a certain percent (see the Moveset section). Its down special, Disable, is a risky option in most situations due to its startup, high ending lag and its requirement that the opponent be facing Mewtwo on the ground for it to work. However, if landed at mid to high percents, it more often than not leads to a guaranteed stock by allowing Mewtwo to punish the opponent with any option that will KO. It additionally has intangibility frames before the attack comes out, making it able to beat out poor grounded approaches and serve as a very niche defensive option in the air.

Mewtwo also possesses a strong grab game. Up and back throw are both among the strongest in the cast, while forward throw is excellent at racking up damage. Its down throw has great combo potential, connecting into forward aerial or up tilt at low to medium percents and even having strong KO setups into forward aerial at about 100% for the majority of the cast. To counteract this, however, Mewtwo's grab range is fairly average overall, which can sometimes hurt the utility of its throws in close-quarters combat or out of shield. In comparison, his dash grab is relatively quick and has great range due to Mewtwo's very fast dash speed, making it a good surprise burst option.

Due to Mewtwo's varied attributes and special moves, its recovery potential is arguably the best in the game. Its combination of having the third-fastest air speed, the highest double jump in the game, low gravity and average falling speed give it great longevity and maneuverability offstage. Teleport, its primary recovery move, covers a long distance and provides full intangibility and directional maneuverability, making it nearly impossible to edgeguard if Mewtwo chooses to teleport to the ledge from above. Furthermore, two of its other special moves offer a form of assistance with recovery: a fully-charged Shadow Ball's recoil can push Mewtwo back far enough to be a viable horizontal recovery option if aimed away from the stage, and Confusion can turn it around, temporarily stalls it in the air when used once and can be combined with the momentum from a rising double jump when used twice to go even higher. With these options, Mewtwo has many ways to mix up its recovery and get safely back onstage, while still being able to punish reckless edgeguarders with its powerful and massive up and back aerials without losing recovery distance.

Lastly, Mewtwo has surprisingly good range for a lightweight fighter. All of its smash attacks have disjointed hitboxes that allow them to beat out attacks safely (especially up smash, as using it at the right time can prevent any stall-then-fall attack). Forward smash can be angled up or down to catch an airborne opponent or to edgeguard low recoveries, respectively. Its tail attacks also offer excellent range, despite not being as disjointed. Its back aerial in particular offers very large coverage behind Mewtwo and can be used in decently quick succession, making it a useful walling tool against opponents with low range attacks. Its tilts also use its tail, so they have good range as well. Tying into this is its aforementioned mobility; Mewtwo's extremely fast horizontal movement speed grants it a very potent punishment game with its range, allowing it to bait approaches and easily punish them with its long-reaching moves.

Despite Mewtwo's strengths, it has some noticeable weaknesses, the most glaring of which is its infamously poor endurance. Mewtwo's very light weight makes it easy to KO, while its tall, awkward frame, average falling speed and below average gravity make it easier to combo compared to other characters of its weight class. Furthermore, Mewtwo lacks an effective aerial move to disrupt combos, and an attempt to Teleport out of a combo can be punished due to its noticeable ending lag and momentum. And compared to all other characters in the game, Mewtwo is also unable to reliably double jump out of juggling pressure due to it taking a noticeable amount of time for his hurtbox to shift vertically. However, its aerial speed and recovery mixup options can mitigate some of these shortcomings.

Although Mewtwo has a multitude of KO options, it often has trouble landing them due to needing to safely approach the enemy. Up and back throw can be risky to attempt because of Mewtwo's aforementioned average grab range. Forward and down smash have slow start-up lag, whereas up smash has minimal horizontal range below its blast of dark energy and high ending lag (it can also unreliably connect due to some jostle animations). Forward aerial and Shadow Ball's KO potentials can be hindered via staleness because of their frequent usage in Mewtwo's combos and neutral game. Lastly, its frame data is slightly below-average, which makes its attacks even more prone to punishment if they are not spaced well and used intentionally. As a result, Mewtwo cannot effectively pressure through offensive means but needs to rely on his movement options and special moves to create openings he can then punish. In disadvantage, he likewise cannot often depend on his offensive options to relieve pressure but must rely on evading and only attacking when necessary.

Overall, Mewtwo is a non-traditional glass cannon who falls under the category of the zoner archetype; it must play cautiously and aware so the opponent does not capitalise on its large hurtbox and light weight. However, this does not mean Mewtwo is forced to rely on turtling, as its outstanding mobility, excellent air game, and overall powerful moveset make it a force to be reckoned with. Instead, Mewtwo should be played very patiently, controlling space (zoning), baiting and poking with Shadow Ball, its aerials and its movement. As such, Mewtwo is a character with a fairly high learning curve, as it has to capitalise on reads more often than not because of its frailty and susceptibility to pressure. While Mewtwo's moveset may not be as versatile as other characters such as Wolf, it makes up for it with comparatively huge power and damage output. In short, Mewtwo has the attack power and range of an archetypal heavyweight character, but still retains the combo game and manoeuvrability of a lightweight character.

Mewtwo's competitive potential is up for debate as of now. Some professional players believe that Mewtwo should be ranked as a high-mid tier character due to its excellent mobility and damage racking game, while other players consider placing it as a low-tier due to its large hurtbox and light weight, as well as its potent neutral being toned down slightly. Mewtwo itself has a small playerbase, but the players who are dedicated to maining the character, like WaDi, have managed to get decent placements.</p>
